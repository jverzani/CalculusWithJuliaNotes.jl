## Graphs of equations


An **equation** in $y$ and $x$ is an algebraic expression involving an equality with two (or more) variables. An example might be $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.


The **solutions** to an equation in the variables $x$ and $y$ are all points $(x,y)$ which satisfy the equation.


The **graph** of an equation is just the set of solutions to the equation represented in the Cartesian plane.


With this definition, the graph of a function $f(x)$ is just the graph of the equation $y = f(x)$. In general, graphing an equation is more complicated than graphing a function. For a function, we know for a given value of $x$ what the corresponding value of $f(x)$ is through evaluation of the function. For equations, we may have $0$, $1$ or more $y$ values for a given $x$ and even more problematic is we may have no rule to find these values.


There are a few options for plotting  equations in `Julia`. We will use `ImplicitPlots` in this section, but note both `ImplicitEquations` and `IntervalConstraintProgramming` offer alternatives that are a bit more flexible.


To plot an implicit equation using `ImplicitPlots` requires expressing the relationship in terms of a function, and then plotting the equation `f(x,y) = 0`. In practice this simply requires all the terms be moved to one side of an equals sign.


To plot the circle of radius $2$, or the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 2^2$ we would move all terms to one side $x^2 + y^2 - 2^2 = 0$ and then express the left hand side through a function:


```{julia}
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2^2
```

This function is then is passed to the `implicit_plot` function, which works with `Plots` to render the graphic:


```{julia}
implicit_plot(f)
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Note
The `f` is a function of *two* variables, used here to express one side of an equation. `Julia` makes this easy to do - just make sure two variables are in the signature of `f` when it is defined. Using functions like this, we can express our equation in the form $f(x,y) = c$ or, more generally, as $f(x,y) = g(x,y)$. The latter of which can be expressed as $h(x,y) = f(x,y) - g(x,y) = 0$. That is, only the form $f(x,y)=0$ is needed to represent an equation.

:::

:::{.callout-note}
## Note
There are two different styles in `Julia` to add simple plot recipes. `ImplicitPlots` adds a new plotting function (`implicit_plot`); alternatively many packages add a new recipe for the generic `plot` method using new types. (For example, `SymPy` has a plot recipe for symbolic types.

:::

Of course, more complicated equations are possible and the steps are similar - only the function definition is more involved.  For example, the [Devils curve](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Curves/Devils.html) has the form


$$
y^4 - x^4 + ay^2 + bx^2 = 0
$$

Here we draw the curve for a particular choice of $a$ and $b$. For illustration purposes, a narrower viewing window is specified below using `xlims` and `ylims`:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
a,b = -1,2
f(x,y) =  y^4 - x^4 + a*y^2 + b*x^2
implicit_plot(f; xlims=(-3,3), ylims=(-3,3), legend=false)
```

## Tangent lines, implicit differentiation


The graph $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ has well-defined tangent lines at all points except $(-1,0)$ and $(0, 1)$ and even at these two points, we could call the vertical lines $x=-1$ and $x=1$ tangent lines. However, to recover the slope of these tangent lines would need us to express $y$ as a function of $x$ and then differentiate that function. Of course, in this example, we would need two functions: $f(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $g(x) = - \sqrt{1-x^2}$ to do this completely.


In general though, we may not be able to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$. What then?


The idea is to *assume* that $y$ is representable by some function of $x$. This makes sense, moving on the curve from $(x,y)$ to some nearby point, means changing $x$ will cause some change in $y$. This assumption is only made *locally* - basically meaning a complicated graph is reduced to just a small, well-behaved, section of its graph.


With this assumption, asking what $dy/dx$ is has an obvious meaning - what is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $(x,y)$. (The assumption eliminates the question of what a tangent line would  mean when a graph self intersects.)


The method of implicit differentiation allows this question to be investigated. It begins by differentiating both sides of the equation assuming $y$ is a function of $x$ to derive a new equation involving $dy/dx$.


For example,  starting with $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, differentiating both sides in $x$ gives:


$$
2x + 2y\cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 0.
$$

The chain rule was used to find $(d/dx)(y^2) = [y(x)^2]' = 2y \cdot dy/dx$. From this we can solve for $dy/dx$ (the resulting equations are linear in $dy/dx$, so can always be solved explicitly):


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}.
$$

This says the slope of the tangent line depends on the point $(x,y)$ through the formula $-x/y$.


As a check, we compare to what we would have found had we solved for $y= \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ (for $(x,y)$ with $y \geq 0$). We would have found: $dy/dx = 1/2 \cdot 1/\sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot (-2x)$. Which can be simplified to $-x/y$. This should show that the method above - assuming $y$ is a function of $x$ and differentiating - is not only more general, but can even be easier.


The name - *implicit differentiation* - comes from the assumption that $y$ is implicitly defined in terms of $x$.  According to the [Implicit Function Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem) the above method will work provided the curve has sufficient smoothness near the point $(x,y)$.


##### Examples


Consider the [serpentine](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Curves/Serpentine.html) equation


$$
x^2y + a\cdot b \cdot y - a^2 \cdot x = 0, \quad a\cdot b > 0.
$$

For $a = 2, b=1$ we have the graph:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
a, b = 2, 1
f(x,y) = x^2*y + a * b * y - a^2 * x
implicit_plot(f)
```

We can see that at each point in the viewing window the tangent line exists due to the smoothness of the curve. Moreover, at a point $(x,y)$ the tangent will have slope $dy/dx$ satisfying:


$$
2xy + x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + a\cdot b \frac{dy}{dx} - a^2 = 0.
$$

Solving, yields:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{a^2 - 2xy}{ab + x^2}.
$$

In particular, the point $(0,0)$ is always on this graph, and the tangent line will have positive slope $a^2/(ab) = a/b$.


---


The [eight](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Curves/Eight.html) curve has representation


$$
x^4 = a^2(x^2-y^2), \quad a \neq 0.
$$

A graph for $a=3$ shows why it has the name it does:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
a = 3
f(x,y) = x^4 - a^2*(x^2 - y^2)
implicit_plot(f)
```

The tangent line at $(x,y)$ will have slope, $dy/dx$ satisfying:


$$
4x^3 = a^2 \cdot (2x - 2y \frac{dy}{dx}).
$$

Solving gives:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{4x^3 - a^2 \cdot 2x}{a^2 \cdot 2y}.
$$

The point $(3,0)$ can be seen to be a solution to the equation and should have a vertical tangent line. This also is reflected in the formula, as the denominator is $a^2\cdot 2 y$, which is $0$ at this point, whereas the numerator is not.


##### Example


The quotient rule can be hard to remember, unlike the product rule. No reason to despair, the product rule plus implicit differentiation can be used to recover the quotient rule. Suppose $y=f(x)/g(x)$, then we could also write $y g(x) = f(x)$. Differentiating implicitly gives:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} g(x) + y g'(x) = f'(x).
$$

Solving for $dy/dx$ gives:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x) - y g'(x)}{g(x)}.
$$

Not quite what we expect, perhaps, but substituting in $f(x)/g(x)$ for $y$ gives us the usual formula:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x) - \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} g'(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x) g(x) - f(x) g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.
$$

:::{.callout-note}
## Note
In this example we mix notations using $g'(x)$ to represent a derivative of $g$ with respect to $x$ and $dy/dx$ to represent the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$. This is done to emphasize the value that we are solving for. It is just a convention though, we could just as well have used the "prime" notation for each.

:::

##### Example: Graphing a tangent line


Let's see how to add a graph of a tangent line to the graph of an equation. Tangent lines are tangent at a point, so we need a point to discuss.


Returning to the equation for a circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, let's look at $(\sqrt{2}/2, - \sqrt{2}/2)$. The derivative is $-y/x$, so the slope at this point is $1$. The line itself has equation $y = b + m \cdot (x-a)$. The following represents this in `Julia`:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1

a,b = sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2

m = -a/b
tl(x) = b + m * (x-a)

implicit_plot(F, xlims=(-2, 2), ylims=(-2, 2), aspect_ratio=:equal)
plot!(tl)
```

We added *both* the implicit plot of $F$ and the tangent line to the graph at the given point.


##### Example


When we assume $y$ is a function of $x$, it may not be feasible to actually find the function algebraically. However, in many cases one can be found numerically. Suppose $G(x,y) = c$ describes the equation. Then for a fixed $x$, $y(x)$ solves $G(x,y(x))) - c = 0$, so $y(x)$ is a zero of a known function. As long as we can piece together which $y$ goes with which, we can find the function.


For example, the [folium](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Curves/Foliumd.html) of Descartes has the equation


$$
x^3 + y^3  = 3axy.
$$

Setting $a=1$ we have the graph:


```{julia}
𝒂 = 1
G(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3*𝒂*x*y
implicit_plot(G)
```

We can solve for the lower curve, $y$, as a function of $x$, as follows:


```{julia}
y1(x) = minimum(find_zeros(y->G(x,y), -10, 10))  # find_zeros from `Roots`
```

This gives the lower part of the curve, which we can plot with:


```{julia}
plot(y1, -5, 5)
```

Though, in this case, the cubic equation would admit a closed-form solution, the approach illustrated applies more generally.


## Using SymPy for computation


`SymPy` can be used to perform implicit differentiation. The three steps are similar: we assume $y$ is a function of $x$, *locally*; differentiate both sides; solve the result for $dy/dx$.


Let's do so for the [Trident of Newton](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Curves/Trident.html), which is represented in Cartesian form as follows:


$$
xy = cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + h.
$$

To approach this task in `SymPy`, we begin by defining our symbolic expression. For now, we keep the parameters as symbolic values:


```{julia}
@syms a b c d x y
ex = x*y - (a*c^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d)
```

To express that `y` is a locally a function of `x`, we use a "symbolic function" object:


```{julia}
@syms u()
```

The object `u` is the symbolic function, and `u(x)` a symbolic expression involving a symbolic function.  This is what we will use to refer to `y`.


Assume $y$ is a function of $x$, called `u(x)`, this substitution is just a renaming:


```{julia}
ex1 = ex(y => u(x))
```

At this point,  we differentiate in `x`:


```{julia}
ex2 = diff(ex1, x)
```

The next step is solve for $dy/dx$ - the lone answer to the linear equation - which is done as follows:


```{julia}
dydx = diff(u(x), x)
ex3 = solve(ex2, dydx)[1]    # pull out lone answer with [1] indexing
```

As this represents an answer in terms of `u(x)`, we replace that term with the original variable:


```{julia}
dydx₁ = ex3(u(x) => y)
```

If `x` and `y` are the variable names, this function will combine the steps above:


```{julia}
function dy_dx(eqn, x, y)
  @syms u()
  eqn1 = eqn(y => u(x))
  eqn2 = solve(diff(eqn1, x), diff(u(x), x))[1]
  eqn2(u(x) => y)
end
```

Let $a = b = c = d = 1$, then $(1,4)$ is a point on the curve. We can draw a tangent line to this point with these commands:


```{julia}
H = ex(a=>1, b=>1, c=>1, d=>1)
x0, y0 = 1, 4
𝒎 = dydx₁(x=>1, y=>4, a=>1, b=>1, c=>1, d=>1)
implicit_plot(lambdify(H); xlims=(-5,5), ylims=(-5,5), legend=false)
plot!(y0 + 𝒎 * (x-x0))
```

Basically this includes all the same steps as if done "by hand." Some effort could have been saved in plotting, had values for the parameters been substituted initially, but not doing so shows their dependence in the derivative.


:::{.callout-warning}
## Warning
The use of `lambdify(H)` is needed to turn the symbolic expression, `H`, into a function.

:::

:::{.callout-note}
## Note
While `SymPy` itself has the `plot_implicit` function for plotting implicit equations,  this works only with `PyPlot`, not `Plots`, so we use the `ImplicitPlots` package in these examples.

:::

## Higher order derivatives


Implicit differentiation can be used to find $d^2y/dx^2$ or other higher-order derivatives. At each stage, the same technique is applied. The only "trick" is that some simplifications can be made.


For example, consider $x^3 - y^3=3$. To find $d^2y/dx^2$, we first find $dy/dx$:


$$
3x^2 - (3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx}) = 0.
$$

We could solve for $dy/dx$ at this point - it always appears as a linear factor - to get:


$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2}{3y^2} = \frac{x^2}{y^2}.
$$

However, we differentiate the first equation, as we generally try to avoid the quotient rule


$$
6x - (6y \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 3y^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}) = 0.
$$

Again, if must be that $d^2y/dx^2$ appears as a linear factor, so we can solve for it:


$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{6x - 6y (\frac{dy}{dx})^2}{3y^2}.
$$

One last substitution for $dy/dx$ gives:


$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{-6x + 6y (\frac{x^2}{y^2})^2}{3y^2} = -2\frac{x}{y^2} + 2\frac{x^4}{y^5} = 2\frac{x}{y^2}(1 - \frac{x^3}{y^3}) = 2\frac{x}{y^5}(y^3 - x^3) = 2 \frac{x}{y^5}(-3).
$$

It isn't so pretty, but that's all it takes.


To visualize, we plot implicitly and notice that:


  * as we change quadrants from the third to the fourth to the first the concavity changes from down to up to down, as the sign of the second derivative changes from negative to positive to negative;
  * and that at these inflection points, the "tangent" line is vertical when $y=0$ and flat when $x=0$.


```{julia}
K(x,y) = x^3 - y^3 - 3
implicit_plot(K,  xlims=(-3, 3), ylims=(-3, 3))
```

The same problem can be done symbolically. The steps are similar, though the last step (replacing $x^3 - y^3$ with $3$) isn't done without explicitly asking.


```{julia}
#| hold: true
@syms x y u()

eqn    = K(x,y) - 3
eqn1   = eqn(y => u(x))
dydx   = solve(diff(eqn1,x), diff(u(x), x))[1]        # 1 solution
d2ydx2 = solve(diff(eqn1, x, 2), diff(u(x),x, 2))[1]  # 1 solution
eqn2   = d2ydx2(diff(u(x), x) => dydx, u(x) => y)
simplify(eqn2)
```

## Inverse functions


As [mentioned](../precalc/inversefunctions.html), an [inverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) function for $f(x)$ is a function $g(x)$ satisfying: $y = f(x)$ if and only if $g(y) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ and $y$ in the range of $f$.


In short, both $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ are identify functions on their respective domains. As inverses are unique, their notation, $f^{-1}(x)$, reflects the name of the related function.


The chain rule can be used to give the derivative of an inverse function when applied to $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$. Solving gives, $[f^{-1}(x)]' = 1 / f'(f^{-1}(x))$.


This is great - if we can remember the rules. If not, sometimes implicit differentiation can also help.


Consider the inverse function for the tangent, which exists when the domain of the tangent function is restricted to $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$. The function solves $y = \tan^{-1}(x)$ or $\tan(y) = x$. Differentiating this yields:


$$
\sec(y)^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 1.
$$

Or $dy/dx = 1/\sec^2(y)$.


But $\sec(y)^2 = 1 + \tan(y)^2 = 1 + x^2$, as can be seen by right-triangle trigonometry. This yields the formula $dy/dx = [\tan^{-1}(x)]' = 1 / (1 + x^2)$.


##### Example


For a more complicated example, suppose we have a moving trajectory $(x(t), y(t))$. The angle it makes with the origin satisfies


$$
\tan(\theta(t)) = \frac{y(t)}{x(t)}.
$$

Suppose $\theta(t)$ can be defined in terms of the inverse to some function ($\tan^{-1}(x)$). We can differentiate implicitly to find $\theta'(t)$ in terms of derivatives of $y$ and $x$:


$$
\sec^2(\theta(t)) \cdot \theta'(t) = \frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x(t))^2}.
$$

But $\sec^2(\theta(t)) = (r(t)/x(t))^2 = (x(t)^2 + y(t)^2) / x(t)^2$, so moving to the other side the secant term gives an explicit, albeit complicated, expression for the derivative of $\theta$ in terms of the functions $x$ and $y$:


$$
\theta'(t) = \frac{x^2}{x^2(t) + y^2(t)} \cdot \frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x(t))^2} = \frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x^2(t) + y^2(t)}.
$$

This could have been made easier, had we leveraged the result of the previous example.


#### Example: from physics


Many problems are best done with implicit derivatives. A video showing such a problem along with how to do it analytically is [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/unit-2-applications-of-differentiation/part-b-optimization-related-rates-and-newtons-method/session-32-ring-on-a-string/).


This video starts with a simple question:


> If you have a rope and heavy ring, where will the ring position itself due to gravity?



Well, suppose you hold the rope in two places, which we can take to be $(0,0)$ and $(a,b)$. Then let $(x,y)$ be all the possible positions of the ring that hold the rope taught. Then we have this picture:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false

	P = (4,1)
	Q = (1, -3)
	scatter([0,4], [0,1], legend=false, xaxis=nothing, yaxis=nothing)
	plot!([0,1,4],[0,-3,1])
	a,b = .05, .25
	ts = range(0, 2pi, length=100)
	plot!(1 .+ a*sin.(ts), -3 .+ b*cos.(ts), color=:gold)
	annotate!((4-0.3,1,"(a,b)"))
	plot!([0,1,1],[0,0,-3], color=:gray, alpha=0.25)
	plot!([1,1,4],[0,1,1], color=:gray, alpha=0.25)
	Δ = 0.15
	annotate!([(1/2, 0-Δ, "x"), (5/2, 1 - Δ, "a-x"), (1-Δ, -1, "|y|"), (1+Δ, -1, "b-y")])
```

Since the length of the rope does not change, we must have for any admissible $(x,y)$ that:


$$
L = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2},
$$

where these terms come from  the two hypotenuses in the figure, as computed through Pythagorean's theorem.


> If we assume that the ring will minimize the value of y subject to this constraint, can we solve for y?



We create a function to represent the equation:


```{julia}
F₀(x, y, a, b) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + sqrt((a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2)
```

To illustrate, we need specific values of $a$, $b$, and $L$:


```{julia}
𝐚, 𝐛, 𝐋 = 3, 3, 10      # L > sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
F₀(x, y) = F₀(x, y, 𝐚, 𝐛)
```

Our values $(x,y)$ must satisfy $f(x,y) = L$. Let's graph:


```{julia}
implicit_plot((x,y) -> F₀(x,y) - 𝐋, xlims=(-5, 7), ylims=(-5, 7))
```

The graph is an ellipse, though slightly tilted.


Okay, now to find the lowest point. This will be when the derivative is $0$. We solve by assuming $y$ is a function of $x$ called `u`. We have already defined symbolic variables `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, here we define `L`:


```{julia}
@syms L
```

Then


```{julia}
eqn = F₀(x,y,a,b) - L
```

```{julia}
eqn_1 = diff(eqn(y => u(x)), x)
eqn_2 = solve(eqn_1, diff(u(x), x))[1]
dydx₂  = eqn_2(u(x) => y)
```

We are looking for when the tangent line has $0$ slope, or when `dydx` is $0$:


```{julia}
cps = solve(dydx₂, x)
```

There are two answers, as we could guess from the graph, but we want the one for the smallest value of $y$, which is the second.


The values of `dydx` depend on any pair $(x,y)$, but our solution must also satisfy the equation. That is for our value of $x$, we need to find the corresponding $y$. This should be possible by substituting:


```{julia}
eqn1 = eqn(x => cps[2])
```

We would try to solve `eqn1` for `y` with `solve(eqn1, y)`, but `SymPy` can't complete this problem. Instead, we will approach this numerically using `find_zero` from the `Roots` package. We make the above a function of `y` alone


```{julia}
eqn2 = eqn1(a=>3, b=>3, L=>10)
ystar = find_zero(eqn2, -3)
```

Okay, now we need to put this value back into our expression for the `x` value and also substitute in for the parameters:


```{julia}
xstar = N(cps[2](y => ystar, a =>3, b => 3, L => 3))
```

Our minimum is at `(xstar, ystar)`, as this graphic shows:


```{julia}

tl(x) = ystar + 0 * (x- xstar)
implicit_plot((x,y) -> F₀(x,y,3,3) - 10, xlims=(-4, 7), ylims=(-10, 10))
plot!(tl)
```

If you watch the video linked to above, you will see that the surprising fact here is the resting point is such that the angles formed by the rope are the same. Basically this makes the tension in both parts of the rope equal, so there is a static position (if not static, the ring would move and not end in the final position). We can verify this fact numerically by showing the arctangents of the two triangles are the same up to a sign:


```{julia}
a0, b0 = 0,0   # the foci of the ellipse are (0,0) and (3,3)
a1, b1 = 3, 3
atan((b0 - ystar)/(a0 - xstar)) + atan((b1 - ystar)/(a1 - xstar)) # ≈ 0
```

Now, were we lucky and just happened to take $a=3$, $b = 3$ in such a way to make this work? Well, no. But convince yourself by doing the above for different values of $b$.


---


In the above, we started with $F(x,y) = L$ and solved symbolically for $y=f(x)$ so that $F(x,f(x)) = L$. Then we took a derivative of $f(x)$ and set this equal to $0$ to solve for the minimum $y$ values.


Here we try the same problem numerically, using a zero-finding approach to identify $f(x))$.


Starting with $F(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (b-2)^2}$ and $L=3$, we have:


```{julia}
F₁(x,y) = F₀(x,y, 1, 2) - 3 # a,b,L = 1,2,3
implicit_plot(F₁)
```

Trying to find the lowest $y$ value we have from the graph it is near $x=0.1$. We can do better.


First, we could try so solve for the $f$ using `find_zero`. Here is one way:


```{julia}
f₀(x) = find_zero(y -> F₁(x, y), 0)
```

We use $0$ as an initial guess, as the $y$ value is near $0$. More on this later. We could then just sample many $x$ values between $-0.5$ and $1.5$ and find the one corresponding to the smallest $t$ value:


```{julia}
findmin([f₀(x) for x ∈ range(-0.5, 1.5, length=100)])

This shows the smallest value is around $-0.414$ and occurs in the $33$rd position of the sampled $x$ values. Pretty good, but we can do better. We just need to differentiate $f$, solve for $f'(x) = 0$ and then put that value back into $f$ to find the smallest $y$.


**However** there is one subtle point. Using automatic differentiation, as implemented in `ForwardDiff`, with `find_zero` requires the `x0` initial value to have a certain type. In this case, the same type as the "`x`" passed into $f(x)$. So rather than use an initial value of $0$, we must use an initial value `zero(x)`! (Otherwise, there will be an error "`no method matching Float64(::ForwardDiff.Dual{...`".)


With this slight modification, we have:


```{julia}
f₁(x) = find_zero(y -> F₁(x, y), zero(x))
plot(f₁', -0.5, 1.5)
```

The zero of `f'` is a bit to the right of $0$, say $0.2$; we use `find_zero` again to find it:


```{julia}
xstar₁ = find_zero(f₁', 0.2)
xstar₁, f₁(xstar₁)
```

It is important to note that the above uses of `find_zero` required *good* initial guesses, which we were fortunate enough to identify.

###### Question


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
### {{{lhopital_35}}}
imgfile = "figures/fcarc-may2016-fig35-350.gif"
caption = """
Image number 35 from L'Hospitals calculus book (the first). Given a description of the curve, identify the point ``E`` which maximizes the height.
"""
ImageFile(:derivatives, imgfile, caption)
```

The figure above shows a problem appearing in L'Hospital's first calculus book. Given a function defined implicitly by $x^3 + y^3 = axy$  (with $AP=x$, $AM=y$ and $AB=a$) find the point $E$ that maximizes the height. In the [AMS feature column](http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fc-2016-05) this problem is illustrated and solved in the historical manner, with the comment that the concept of implicit differentiation wouldn't have occurred to L'Hospital.


Using Implicit differentiation, find when $dy/dx = 0$.


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
choices = ["``y^2 = 3x/a``", "``y=3x^2/a``", "``y=a/(3x^2)``", "``y^2=a/(3x)``"]
answ = 2
radioq(choices, answ)
```

Substituting the correct value of $y$, above, into the defining equation gives what value for $x$:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
choices=[
"``x=(1/2) a 2^{1/2}``",
"``x=(1/3) a 2^{1/3}``",
"``x=(1/2) a^3 3^{1/3}``",
"``x=(1/3) a^2 2^{1/2}``"
]
answ = 2
radioq(choices, answ)
```

###### Question


For the equation of an ellipse:


$$
\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1,
$$

compute $d^2y/dx^2$. Is this the answer?


$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{b^2}{a^2\cdot y} - \frac{b^4\cdot x^2}{a^4\cdot y^3} = -\frac{1}{y}\frac{b^2}{a^2}(1 + \frac{b^2 x^2}{a^2 y^2}).
$$

```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
yesnoq(true)
```

If $y>0$ is the sign positive or negative?


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
choices = ["positive", "negative", "Can be both"]
answ = 2
radioq(choices, answ, keep_order=true)
```

If $x>0$ is the sign positive or negative?


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
choices = ["positive", "negative", "Can be both"]
answ = 3
radioq(choices, answ, keep_order=true)
```

When $x>0$, the graph of the equation is...


```{julia}
#| hold: true
#| echo: false
choices = ["concave up", "concave down", "both concave up and down"]
answ = 3
radioq(choices, answ, keep_order=true)
```

## Appendix


There are other packages in the `Julia` ecosystem that can plot implicit equations.


### The ImplicitEquations package


The `ImplicitEquations` packages can plot equations and inequalities. The use is somewhat similar to the examples above, but the object plotted is a predicate, not a function. These predicates are created with functions like `Eq` or `Lt`.


For example, the `ImplicitPlots` manual shows this function $f(x,y) = (x^4 + y^4 - 1) \cdot (x^2 + y^2 - 2) + x^5 \cdot y$ to plot. Using `ImplicitEquations`, this equation would be plotted with:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
using ImplicitEquations
f(x,y) = (x^4 + y^4 - 1) * (x^2 + y^2 - 2) + x^5 * y
r = Eq(f, 0)  # the equation f(x,y) = 0
plot(r)
```

Unlike `ImplicitPlots`, inequalities may be displayed:


```{julia}
#| hold: true
f(x,y) = (x^4 + y^4 - 1) * (x^2 + y^2 - 2) + x^5 * y
r = Lt(f, 0)          # the inequality f(x,y) < 0
plot(r; M=10, N=10)  # less blocky
```

The rendered plots look "blocky" due to the algorithm used to plot the equations. As there is no rule defining $(x,y)$ pairs to plot, a search by regions is done. A region is initially labeled undetermined. If it can be shown that for any value in the region the equation is true (equations can also be inequalities), the region is colored black. If it can be shown it will never be true, the region is dropped. If a black-and-white answer is not clear, the region is subdivided and each subregion is similarly tested. This continues until the remaining undecided regions are smaller than some threshold. Such regions comprise a boundary, and here are also colored black. Only regions are plotted - not $(x,y)$ pairs - so the results are blocky. Pass larger values of $N=M$ (with defaults of $8$) to `plot` to lower the threshold at the cost of longer computation times, as seen in the last example.


### The IntervalConstraintProgramming package


The `IntervalConstraintProgramming` package also can be used to graph implicit equations. For certain problem descriptions it is significantly faster and makes better graphs. The usage is slightly more involved. We show the commands, but don't run them here, as there are minor conflicts with the `CalculusWithJulia`package.


We specify a problem using the `@constraint` macro. Using a macro allows expressions to involve free symbols, so the problem is specified in an equation-like manner:


```{julia}
#| eval: false
S = @constraint x^2 + y^2 <= 2
```

The right hand side must be a number.


The area to plot over must be specified as an `IntervalBox`, basically a pair of intervals. The interval $[a,b]$ is expressed through `a..b`:


```{julia}
#| eval: false
J = -3..3
X = IntervalArithmetic.IntervalBox(J, J)
```

The `pave` command does the heavy lifting:


```{julia}
#| eval: false
region = IntervalConstraintProgramming.pave(S, X)
```

A plot can be made of either the boundary, the interior, or both.


```{julia}
#| eval: false
plot(region.inner)       # plot interior; use r.boundary for boundary
```
