Sounds promising, but how much will that costume weigh? A very hot summer may make walking around in a heavy costume quite uncomfortable.\n\n\nA back-of-the envelope calculation would start by\n\n\n  * Mentally separating out each \"tire\" and lining them up one by one.\n  * Counting the number of \"tires\" (or rings), say $n$.\n  * Estimating the radius for each tire, say $r_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n  * Estimating the height for each tire, say $h_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$\n\n\nThen the volume would be found by adding:\n\n\n\n$$\nV = \\pi \\cdot r_1^2 \\cdot h_1 + \\pi \\cdot r_2^2 \\cdot h_2 + \\cdot + \\pi \\cdot r_n^2 \\cdot h_n.\n$$\n\n\nThe weight would come by multiplying the volume by some appropriate density.\n\n\nLooking at the sum though, we see the makings of an approximate integral. If the heights were to get infinitely small, we might expect this to approach something like $V=\\int_a^b \\pi r(h)^2  dh$.\n\n\nIn fact, we have in general:\n\n\n> **Volume of a figure with a known cross section**: The volume of a solid with known cross-sectional area $A_{xc}(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by\n>\n> $V = \\int_a^b A_{xc}(x) dx.$\n>\n> This assumes $A_{xc}(x)$ is integrable.\n\n\n\nThis formula is derived by approximating the volume by \"slabs\" with volume $A_{xc}(x) \\Delta x$ and using the Riemann integral's definition to pass to the limit. The discs of the Michelin man are an example, where the cross-sectional area is just that of a circle, or $\\pi r^2$.\n\n\n## Solids of revolution\n\n\nWe begin with some examples of a special class of solids - solids of revolution. These have an axis of symmetry from which the slabs are then just circular disks.\n\n\nConsider the volume contained in this glass, it will depend on the radius at different values of $x$:\n\n![ A wine glass oriented so that it is seen as generated by revolving a curve about the $x$ axis. The radius of revolution varies as a function of $x$ between about $0$ and $6.2$cm.\n\n](../integrals/figures/integration-glass.jpg)\n\n\n\nIf $r(x)$ is the radius as a function of $x$, then the cross sectional area is $\\pi r(x)^2$ so the volume is given by:\n\n\n\n$$\nV = \\int_a^b \\pi r(x)^2 dx.\n$$\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nThe formula is for a rotation around the $x$-axis, but can easily be generalized to rotating around any line (say the $y$-axis or $y=x$, ...) just by adjusting what $r(x)$ is taken to be.\n\n:::\n\nFor a numeric example, we consider the original Red [Solo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Solo_Cup) Cup.

If we rotate the cup so this is the $x$-axis, then we can get\n\n\n\n$$\nr(x) = \\frac{d_0}{2} + \\frac{d_1/2 - d_0/2}{h}x = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{5}{38}x\n$$\n\n\nThe volume in cubic inches will be:\n\n\n\n$$\nV = \\int_0^h \\pi r(x)^2 dx\n$$\n\n\nThis is\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nd0, d1, h = 2.5, 3.75, 4.75\nrad(x) = d0/2 + (d1/2 - d0/2)/h * x\nvol, _ = quadgk(x -> pi * rad(x)^2, 0, h)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n(36.917804295114436, 7.105427357601002e-15)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo $36.9 \\text{in}^3$.

What is the volume now?\n\n\nThe difference, of course, is that cross sections now have area $d^2$, as opposed to $\\pi r^2$. This leads to some difference, which we quantify, as follows:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=21}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nd0, d1, h = 2.5, 3.75, 4.75\nd(x) = d0 + (d1 - d0)/h * x\nvol, _ = quadgk(x -> d(x)^2, 0, h)\nvol / 231 * 128\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=22}\n```\n26.046176046176043\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis shape would have more volume - the cross sections are bigger. Presumably the dimensions have changed. Without going out and buying a cup, let's assume the cross-sectional diameter remained the same, not the diameter. This means the largest dimension is the same. The cross section diameter is $\\sqrt{2}$ larger. What would this do to the area?\n\n\nWe could do this two ways: divide $d_0$ and $d_1$ by $\\sqrt{2}$ and recompute. However, each cross section of this narrower cup would simply be $\\sqrt{2}^2$ smaller, so the total volume would change by $2$, or be 13 ounces. We have $26.04$ is too big, and $13.02$ is too small, so some other overall dimensions are used.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nFor a general cone, we use this [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone):\n\n\n> A cone is the solid figure bounded by a base in a plane and by a surface (called the lateral surface) formed by the locus of all straight line segments joining the apex to the perimeter of the base.\n\n\n\nLet $h$ be the distance from the apex to the base. Consider cones with the property that all planes parallel to the base intersect the cone with the same shape, though perhaps a different scale. This figure shows an example, with the rays coming from the apex defining the volume.\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=22}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=23}\n![](volumes_slice_files/figure-html/cell-23-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA right circular cone is one where this shape is a circle. This definition can be more general, as a square-based right pyramid is also such a cone. After possibly reorienting the cone in space so the base is at $u=0$ and the apex at $u=h$ the volume of the cone can be found from:\n\n\n\n$$\nV = \\int_0^h A_{xc}(u) du.\n$$\n\n\nThe cross sectional area $A_{xc}(u)$ satisfies a formula in terms of $A_{xc}(0)$, the area of the base:\n\n\n\n$$\nA_{xc}(u)  = A_{xc}(0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{u}{h})^2\n$$\n\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\n\n$$\nV = \\int_0^h A_{xc}(u) du = A_{xc}(0) \\int_0^h (1 - \\frac{u}{h})^2 du = A_{xc}(0) \\int_0^1 v^2 \\frac{1}{h} dv = A_{xc}(0) \\frac{h}{3}.\n$$\n\n\nThis gives a general formula for the volume of such cones.\n\n\n### Cavalieri's method\n\n\n[Cavalieri's](http://tinyurl.com/oda9xd9) Principle is \"Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in cross-sections of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.\" (Wikipedia).\n\n\nWith the formula for the volume of solids based on cross sections, this is a trivial observation, as the functions giving the cross-sectional area are identical. Still, it can be surprising. Consider a sphere with an interior cylinder bored out of it.  (The [Napkin](http://tinyurl.com/o237v83) ring problem.) The bore has height $h$ - for larger radius spheres this means very wide bores.\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=23}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=24}\n![](volumes_slice_files/figure-html/cell-24-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe small orange line is rotated, so using the washer method we get the cross sections given by $\\pi(r_0^2 - r_i^2)$, the outer and inner radii, as a function of $y$.\n\n\nThe outer radii has points $(x,y)$ satisfying $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$, so is $\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2}$. The inner radii has a constant value, and as indicated in the figure, is $\\sqrt{R^2 - (h/2)^2}$, by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n\nThus the cross sectional area is\n\n\n\n$$\n\\pi( (\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2})^2 - (\\sqrt{R^2 - (h/2)^2})^2 )\n= \\pi ((R^2 - y^2) - (R^2 - (h/2)^2))\n= \\pi ((\\frac{h}{2})^2 - y^2)\n$$\n\n\nAs this does not depend on $R$, and the limits of integration would always be $-h/2$ to $h/2$ by Cavalieri's principle, the volume of the solid will be independent of $R$ too.\n\n\nTo actually compute this volume, we take $R=h/2$, so that the bore hole is just a line of no volume, the resulting volume is then that of a sphere with radius $h/2$, or $4/3\\pi(h/2)^3 = \\pi h^3/6$.\n\n\n## The second theorem of Pappus\n\n\nThe second theorem of [Pappus](http://tinyurl.com/l43vw4) says that if a plane figure $F$ is rotated around an axis to form a solid of revolution, the total volume can be written as $2\\pi r A(F)$, where $r$ is the distance the centroid is from the axis of revolution, and $A(F)$ is the area of the plane figure. In short, the distance traveled by the centroid times the area.\n\n\nThis can make some computations trivial. For example, we can make a torus (or donut) by rotating the circle $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 1$ about the $y$ axis. As the centroid is clearly $(2, 0)$, with $r=2$ in the above formula, and the area of the circle is $\\pi 1^2$, the volume of the donut is $2\\pi(2)(\\pi) = 4\\pi^2$.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nAbove, we found the volume of a cone, as it is a solid of revolution, through the general formula. However, parameterizing the cone as the revolution of a triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(r, 0)$, and $(0,h)$ and using the formula for the center of mass in the $x$ direction of such a triangle, $r/3$, we get that the volume of a cone with height $h$ and radius $r$ is  $2\\pi (r/3)\\cdot (rh/2) = \\pi r^2 h/3$, in agreement with the calculus based computation.\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n###### Question\n\n\nConsider this big Solo cup:\n\n![ Big solo cup. ](../integrals/figures/big-solo-cup.jpg)\n\n\n\nIt has approximate dimensions: smaller radius 5 feet, upper radius 8 feet and height 15 feet.
