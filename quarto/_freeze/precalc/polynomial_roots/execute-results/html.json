For example, the polynomial $x^2 - x$ has two roots, $0$ and $1$. A simple graph verifies this:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=4}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x) = x^2 - x\nplot(f, -2, 2)\nplot!(zero, -2, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe graph crosses the $x$-axis at both $0$ and $1$.\n\n\nWhat is known about polynomial roots? Some simple questions might be:\n\n\n  * Will a polynomial always have a root?\n  * How many roots can there be?\n  * How large can the roots be?\n\n\nWe look at such questions here.\n\n\n### The factor theorem\n\n\nWe begin with a comment that ties together two concepts related to polynomials. It allows us to speak of roots or factors interchangeably:\n\n\n> The [factor theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_theorem) relates the *roots* of a polynomial with its *factors*: $r$ is a root of $p$ if *and* only if $(x-r)$ is a factor of the polynomial $p$.\n\n\n\nClearly, if $p$ is factored as $a(x-r_1) \\cdot (x-r_2) \\cdots (x - r_k)$ then each $r_i$ is a root, as a product involving at least one $0$ term will be $0$. The other implication is a consequence of polynomial division.\n\n\n### Polynomial Division\n\n\n[Euclidean division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) of integers $a, b$ uniquely writes $a = b\\cdot q + r$ where $0 \\leq r < |b|$. The quotient is $q$ and the remainder $r$. There is an analogy for polynomial division, where for two polynomial functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ it is possible to write\n\n\n\n$$\nf(x) = g(x) \\cdot q(x) + r(x)\n$$\n\n\nwhere the degree of $r$ is less than the degree of $g(x)$. The [long-division algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division) can be used to find both $q(x)$ and $r(x)$.\n\n\nFor the special case of a linear factor where $g(x) = x - c$,  the remainder must be of degree $0$ (a non-zero constant) or the $0$ polynomial. The above simplifies to\n\n\n\n$$\nf(x) = (x-c) \\cdot q(x) + r\n$$\n\n\nFrom this, we see that $f(c) = r$. Hence, when $c$ is a root of $f(x)$, then it must be that $r=0$ and so, $(x-c)$ is a factor.\n\n\n---\n\nThe division algorithm for the case of linear term, $(x-c)$, can be carried out by the [synthetic division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_division) algorithm. This algorithm produces  $q(x)$ and $r$, a.k.a $f(c)$.  The Wikipedia page describes the algorithm well.\n\n\nThe following is an example where $f(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 + 5$ and $g(x) = x-2$:\n\n\n\n```{verbatim}\n2 | 1 0 2  0  5\n  |   2 4 12 24\n  -------------\n    1 2 6 12 29\n```\n\n\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is coded in terms of its coefficients ($a_n$, $a_{n-1}$, $\\dots$, $a_1$, $a_0$) and is written on the top row. The algorithm then proceeds from left to right. The number just produced on the bottom row is multiplied by $c$ and placed under the coefficient of $f(x)$. Then values are then added to produce the next number. The sequence produced above is `1 2 6 12 29`. The last value (`29`) is $r=f(c)$, the others encode the coefficients of `q(x)`, which for this problem is $q(x)=x^3 + 2x + 6 + 12$.  That is, we have written:\n\n\n\n$$\nx^4 + 2x^2 + 5 = (x-2) \\cdot (x^3 + 2x + 6 + 12) + 29.\n$$\n\n\nAs $r$ is not $0$, we can say that $2$ is not a root of $f(x)$.\n\n\nIf we were to track down the computation that produced $f(2) = 29$, we would have\n\n\n\n$$\n5 + 2 \\cdot (0 + 2 \\cdot (2 + 2 \\cdot (0 + (2 \\cdot 1))))\n$$\n\n\nIn terms of $c$ and the coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$, and $a_4$ this is\n\n\n\n$$\na_0 + c\\cdot(a_1 + c\\cdot(a_2 + c\\cdot(a_3 + c\\cdot a_4))),\n$$\n\n\nThe above pattern provides a means to compute $f(c)$ and could easily be generalized for higher degree polynomials.  This generalization is called [Horner's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method) method. Horner's method has the advantage of also being faster and more accurate when floating point issues are accounted for.\n\n\nA simple implementation of Horner's algorithm would look like this, if indexing were `0`-based:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction horner(p, x)\n    n = degree(p)\n    Σ = p[n]\n    for i in (n-1):-1:0\n       Σ = Σ * x + p[i]\n    end\n    return(Σ)\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\nhorner (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRecording the different values of `Σ` would recover the polynomial `q`.\n\n\n`Julia` has a built-in method, `evalpoly`, to compute polynomial evaluations this way. To illustrate:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms x::real       # assumes x is real\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n(x,)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=7}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\np = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4\nevalpoly(x, p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\nx \\left(x \\left(x \\left(5 x + 4\\right) + 3\\right) + 2\\right) + 1\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe `SymPy` package can carry out polynomial long division.\n\n\nThis naive attempt to divide won't \"just work\" though:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n(x^4 + 2x^2 + 5) / (x-2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n\\frac{x^{4} + 2 x^{2} + 5}{x - 2}\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`SymPy` is fairly conservative in how it simplifies answers, and, as written, there is no compelling reason to change the expressions, though in our example we want it done.\n\n\nFor this task, `divrem` is available:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nquotient, remainder = divrem(x^4 + 2x^2 + 5, x - 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n(x^3 + 2*x^2 + 6*x + 12, 29)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe answer is a tuple containing the quotient and remainder. The quotient itself could be found with `div` or `÷` and the remainder with `rem`.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nFor those who have worked with SymPy within Python, `divrem` is the `div` method renamed, as `Julia`'s `div` method has the generic meaning of returning the quotient.\n\n:::\n\nAs well, the `apart` function could  be used for this task. This function computes the [partial fraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_fraction_decomposition)  decomposition of a ratio of polynomial functions.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\napart((x^4 + 2x^2 + 5) / (x-2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\nx^{3} + 2 x^{2} + 6 x + 12 + \\frac{29}{x - 2}\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `together` would combine such terms, as an \"inverse\" to `apart`. This isn't so much of interest at the moment, but will be when techniques of integration are looked at.\n\n\n### The rational root theorem\n\n\nFactoring polynomials to find roots is a task that most all readers here will recognize, and, perhaps, remember not so fondly. One helpful trick to find possible roots *by hand* is the [rational root theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem): if a polynomial has integer coefficients with $a_0 \\neq 0$, than any rational root, $p/q$, must have $p$ dividing the constant $a_0$ and $q$ dividing the leading term $a_n$.\n\n\nTo glimpse why, suppose we have a polynomial with a rational root and integer coefficients. With this in mind, a polynomial with identical roots may be written as $(qx -p)(a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots a_1 x + a_0)$, where each coefficient is an integer. Multiplying through, we get that the polynomial is $qa_{n-1}x^n + \\cdots + pa_0$. So $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient and $p$ is a factor of the constant.\n\n\nAn immediate consequence is that if the polynomial with integer coefficients is monic, then any rational root must be an integer.\n\n\nThis gives a finite - though possibly large - set of values that can be checked to exhaust the possibility of a rational root. By hand this process can be tedious, though may be speeded up using synthetic division. This task is one of the mainstays of high school algebra where problems are chosen judiciously to avoid too many possibilities.\n\n\nHowever, one of the great triumphs of computer algebra is the ability to factor polynomials with integer (or rational) coefficients over the rational numbers. This is typically done by first factoring over modular numbers (akin to those on a clock face) and has nothing to do with the rational root test.\n\n\n`SymPy` can quickly find such a factorization, even for quite large polynomials with rational or integer coefficients.\n\n\nFor example, factoring $p = 2x^4 + x^3 -19x^2 -9x +9$. This has *possible* rational roots of plus or minus $1$ or $2$ divided by $1$, $3$, or $9$ - $12$ possible answers for this modest question. By hand that can be a bit of work, but `factor` does it without fuss:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=11}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\np = 2x^4 + x^3 - 19x^2 - 9x + 9\nfactor(p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n\\left(x - 3\\right) \\left(x + 1\\right) \\left(x + 3\\right) \\left(2 x - 1\\right)\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The fundamental theorem of algebra\n\n\nThere is a basic fact about the roots of a polynomial of degree $n$. Before formally stating it, we consider the earlier observation that a polynomial of degree $n$ for large values of $x$ has a graph that looks like the leading term. However, except at $0$, monomials do not cross the $x$ axis, the roots must be the result of the interaction of lower order terms. Intuitively, since each term can contribute only one basic shape up or down, there can not be arbitrarily many roots. In fact, a consequence of the [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra) (Gauss) is:\n\n\n> A polynomial of degree $n$ with real or complex coefficients has at most $n$ real roots.\n\n\n\nThis statement can be proved with the factor theorem and the division algorithm.\n\n\nIn fact the fundamental theorem states that there are exactly $n$ roots, though, in general, one must consider multiple roots and possible complex roots to get all $n$. (Consider $x^2$ to see why multiplicity must be accounted for and $x^2 + 1$ to see why complex values may be necessary.)\n\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## Warning\nThe special case of the $0$ polynomial having no degree defined eliminates needing to exclude it, as it has infinitely many roots. Otherwise, the language would be qualified to have $n \\geq 0$.\n\n:::\n\n## Finding roots of a polynomial\n\n\nKnowing that a certain number of roots exist and actually finding those roots are different matters. For the simplest cases (the linear case) with $a_0 + a_1x$, we know by solving algebraically that the root is $-a_0/a_1$. (We assume $a_1\\neq 0$.) Of course, when $a_1 \\neq 0$, the graph of the polynomial will be a line with some non-zero slope, so will cross the $x$-axis as the line and this axis are not parallel.\n\n\nFor the quadratic case, there is the famous [quadratic formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula) (known since $2000$ BC) to find the two roots guaranteed by the formula:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\n$$\n\n\nThe discriminant is defined as $b^2 - 4ac$. When this is negative, the square root requires the concept of complex numbers to be defined, and the formula shows the two complex roots are conjugates. When the discriminant is $0$, then the root has multiplicity two, e.g., the polynomial will factor as $a_2(x-r)^2$. Finally, when the discriminant is positive, there will be two distinct, real roots. This figure shows the $3$ cases, that are illustrated by $x^2 -1$, $x^2$ and $x^2 + 1$:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nplot(x^2 - 1,  -2, 2, legend=false)  # two roots\nplot!(x^2, -2, 2)                           # one (double) root\nplot!(x^2 + 1, -2, 2)                       # no real root\nplot!(zero, -2, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are similar formulas for the [cubic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#General_formula_for_roots) and [quartic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#General_formula_for_roots) cases. (The [cubic formula](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0005026v1.pdf) was known to Cardano in $1545$, though through Tartagli, and the quartic was solved by Ferrari, Cardano's roommate.)\n\n\nIn general, there is no such formula using radicals for $5$th degree polynomials or higher, a proof first given by Ruffini in $1803$ with improvement by Abel in $1824$. Even though the fundamental theorem shows that any polynomial can be factored into linear and quadratic terms, there is no general method as to how. (It is the case that *some* such polynomials may be solvable by radicals, just not all of them.)\n\n\nThe `factor` function of `SymPy` only finds factors of polynomials with integer or rational coefficients corresponding to rational roots. There are alternatives.\n\n\nFinding roots with `SymPy` can also be done through its `solve` function, a function which also has a more general usage, as it can solve simple expressions or more than one expression. Here we illustrate that `solve` can easily handle quadratic expressions:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsolve(x^2 + 2x - 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n -3\n  1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe answer is a vector of values that when substituted in for the free variable `x` produce $0.$ The call to `solve` does not have an equals sign. To solve a more complicated expression of the type $f(x) = g(x),$ one can solve $f(x) - g(x) = 0,$ use the `Eq` function, or use `f ~ g`.\n\n\nWhen the expression to solve has more than one free variable, the variable to solve for should be explicitly stated with a second argument. For example, here we show that `solve` is aware of the quadratic formula:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms a b::real c::positive\nsolve(a*x^2 + b*x + c, x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n (-b - sqrt(-4*a*c + b^2))/(2*a)\n (-b + sqrt(-4*a*c + b^2))/(2*a)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `solve` function will respect assumptions made when a variable is defined through `symbols` or `@syms`:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsolve(a^2 + 1)     # works, as a can be complex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n -ⅈ\n  ⅈ\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsolve(b^2 + 1)     # fails, as b is assumed real\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n```\nAny[]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsolve(c + 1)       # fails, as c is assumed positive\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=18}\n```\nAny[]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPreviously, it was mentioned that `factor` only factors polynomials with integer coefficients over rational roots. However, `solve` can be used to factor.

(This is similar, but different than qualifying by a `Julia` module when there are two conflicting names. An example will be the use of the name `roots` in both `SymPy` and `Polynomials` to refer to a function that finds the roots of a polynomial.

The main reason being that `solve` has too many different output types (a vector, a dictionary, ...). The output of `solveset` is always a set. For tasks like this, which return a finite set, we use the `elements` function to access the individual answers. To illustrate:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n𝒑 = 8x^4 - 8x^2  + 1\n𝒑_rts = solveset(𝒑)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=29}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n\\left\\{- \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}}, - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\}\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `𝒑_rts` object, a `FiniteSet`, does not allow immediate access to its elements.

This feeling is perhaps motivated by the examples given in textbooks to be worked by hand, which necessarily focus on smallish solutions. But, in general, without some sense of where the roots are, an informative graph itself can be hard to produce. That is, technology doesn't displace thinking - it only supplements it.\n\n\nFor another example, consider the polynomial $(x-20)^5 - (x-20) + 1$. In this form we might think the roots are near $20$. However, were we presented with this polynomial in expanded form: $x^5 - 100x^4 + 4000x^3 - 80000x^2 + 799999x - 3199979$, we might be tempted to just graph it to find roots.  A naive graph might be to plot over $[-10, 10]$:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n𝐩 =   x^5 - 100x^4 + 4000x^3 - 80000x^2 + 799999x - 3199979\nplot(𝐩, -10, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=32}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-32-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to indicate a root near $10$. But look at the scale of the $y$ axis. The value at $-10$ is around $-25,000,000$ so it is really hard to tell if $f$ is near $0$ when $x=10$, as the range is too large.\n\n\nA graph over $[10,20]$ is still unclear:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=32}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nplot(𝐩, 10,20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=33}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-33-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that what looked like a zero near $10$, was actually a number around $-100,000$.\n\n\nContinuing, a plot over $[15, 20]$ still isn't that useful. It isn't until we get close to $18$ that the large values of the polynomial allow a clear vision of the values near $0$. That being said, plotting anything bigger than $22$ quickly makes the large values hide those near $0$, and might make us think where the function dips back down there is a second or third zero, when only $1$ is the case. (We know that, as this is the same $x^5 - x + 1$ shifted to the right by $20$ units.)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nplot(𝐩, 18, 22)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=34}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-34-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNot that it can't be done, but graphically solving for a root here can require some judicious choice of viewing window. Even worse is the case where something might graphically look like a root, but in fact not be a root. Something like $(x-100)^2 + 0.1$ will demonstrate.\n\n\nFor another example, the following polynomial when plotted over $[-5,7]$ appears to have two real roots:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=34}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nh = x^7 - 16129x^2 + 254x - 1\nplot(h, -5, 7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=35}\n![](polynomial_roots_files/figure-html/cell-35-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nin fact there are three, two are *very* close together:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=35}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nN.(solve(h))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=36}\n```\n3-element Vector{BigFloat}:\n 0.007874015406930341157555003028161633376551552518768059431667490175426147404348286\n 0.007874016089132754403608727898779727134193464194254785228308443233139693780655877\n 6.939437409621392124436713492447610272200680501712185816507667632045076114762801\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nThe difference of the two roots is around `1e-10`. For the graph over the interval of $[-5,7]$ there are about $800$ \"pixels\" used, so each pixel represents a size of about `1.5e-2`. So the cluster of roots would safely be hidden under a single \"pixel.\"\n\n:::\n\nThe point of this is to say, that it is useful to know where to look for roots, even if graphing calculators or graphing programs make drawing graphs relatively painless. A better way in this case would be to find the real roots first, and then incorporate that information into the choice of plot window.\n\n\n## Some facts about the real roots of a polynomial\n\n\nA polynomial with real coefficients may or may not have real roots. The following discusses some simple checks on the number of real roots and bounds on how big they can be. This can be *roughly* used to narrow viewing windows when graphing polynomials.\n\n\n### Descartes' rule of signs\n\n\nThe study of polynomial roots is an old one. In $1637$ Descartes published a *simple* method to determine an upper bound on the number of *positive* real roots of a polynomial.\n\n\n> [Descartes' rule of signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_rule_of_signs): if  $p=a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots a_1x + a_0$ then the number of  positive real roots is  either equal to the number of  sign differences between consecutive nonzero coefficients, or is  less than it by an even number. Repeated roots are counted separately.\n\n\n\nOne method of proof (sketched at the end of this section) first shows that in synthetic division by $(x-c)$ with $c > 0$, we must have that any sign change in $q$ is related to a sign change in $p$ and there must be at least one more in $p$. This is then used to show that there can be only as many positive roots as sign changes. That the difference comes in pairs is related to complex roots of real polynomials always coming in pairs.\n\n\nAn immediate consequence, is that a polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative will have no positive real roots.\n\n\nApplying this to the polynomial $x^5 -x + 1$ we get That the coefficients have signs: `+ 0 0 0 - +` which collapses to the sign pattern `+`, `-`, `+`. This pattern  has two changes of sign. The number of *positive* real roots is either $2$ or $0$. In fact there are $0$ for this case.\n\n\nWhat about negative roots? Cleary, any negative root of $p$ is a positive root of $q(x) = p(-x)$, as the graph of $q$ is just that of $p$ flipped through the $y$ axis. But the coefficients of $q$ are the same as $p$, except for the odd-indexed coefficients ($a_1, a_3, \\dots$) have a changed sign.  Continuing with our example, for $q(x) = -x^5 + x + 1$ we get the new sign pattern `-`, `+`, `+` which yields one sign change. That is, there *must* be a negative real root, and indeed there is, $x \\approx -1.1673$.\n\n\nWith this knowledge, we could have known that in an earlier example the graph of `p = x^7 - 16129x^2 + 254x - 1` – which indicated two positive real roots – was misleading, as there must be $1$ or $3$ by a count of the sign changes.\n\n\nFor another example, if we looked at $f(x) = x^5 - 100x^4 + 4000x^3 - 80000x^2 + 799999x - 3199979$ again, we see that there could be $1$, $3$, or $5$ *positive* roots. However, changing the signs of the odd powers leaves all \"-\" signs, so there are $0$ negative roots. From the graph, we saw just $1$ real root, not $3$ or $5$. We can verify numerically with:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nj =  x^5 - 100x^4 + 4000x^3 - 80000x^2 + 799999x - 3199979\nN.(solve(j))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=37}\n```\n1-element Vector{BigFloat}:\n 18.83269602173858131574395410014515781927943962847451096085991755072434809657041\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Cauchy's bound on the magnitude of the real roots.\n\n\nDescartes' rule gives a bound on how many real roots there may be. Cauchy provided a bound on how large they can be. Assume our polynomial is monic (if not, divide by $a_n$ to make it so, as this won't effect the roots). Then any real root is no larger in absolute value than $|a_0| + |a_1| + |a_2| + \\cdots + |a_n|$, (this is expressed in different ways.)\n\n\nTo see precisely [why](https://captainblack.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/cauchys-upper-bound-for-the-roots-of-a-polynomial/) this bound works, suppose $x$ is a root with $|x| > 1$ and let $h$ be the bound. Then since $x$ is a root, we can solve $a_0 + a_1x + \\cdots + 1 \\cdot x^n = 0$ for $x^n$ as:\n\n\n\n$$\nx^n = -(a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots a_{n-1}x^{n-1})\n$$\n\n\nWhich after taking absolute values of both sides, yields:\n\n\n\n$$\n|x^n| \\leq |a_0| + |a_1||x| + |a_2||x^2| + \\cdots |a_{n-1}| |x^{n-1}| \\leq (h-1) (1 + |x| + |x^2| + \\cdots |x^{n-1}|).\n$$\n\n\nThe last sum can be computed using a formula for geometric sums, $(|x^n| - 1)/(|x|-1)$. Rearranging, gives the inequality:\n\n\n\n$$\n|x| - 1 \\leq (h-1) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{|x^n|} ) \\leq (h-1)\n$$\n\n\nfrom which it follows that $|x| \\leq h$, as desired.\n\n\nFor our polynomial $x^5 -x + 1$ we have the sum above is $3$. The lone real root is approximately $-1.1673$ which satisfies $|-1.1673| \\leq 3$.\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n###### Question\n\n\nWhat is the remainder of dividing $x^4 - x^3 - x^2 + 2$ by $x-2$?\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=37}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=38}\n```{=html}\n<form class=\"mx-2 my-3 mw-100\" name='WeaveQuestion' data-id='14318082245935350206' data-controltype=''>\n  <div class='form-group '>\n    <div class='controls'>\n      <div class=\"form\" id=\"controls_14318082245935350206\">\n        <div style=\"padding-top: 5px\">\n    <div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_14318082245935350206_1\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_14318082245935350206\"\n              id=\"radio_14318082245935350206_1\" value=\"1\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(x^3 + x^2 + x + 2\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_14318082245935350206_2\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_14318082245935350206\"\n              id=\"radio_14318082245935350206_2\" value=\"2\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(0\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_14318082245935350206_3\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_14318082245935350206\"\n              id=\"radio_14318082245935350206_3\" value=\"3\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(x-2\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_14318082245935350206_4\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_14318082245935350206\"\n              id=\"radio_14318082245935350206_4\" value=\"4\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(6\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n\n    \n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div id='14318082245935350206_message' style=\"padding-bottom: 15px\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n<script text='text/javascript'>\ndocument.querySelectorAll('input[name=\"radio_14318082245935350206\"]').forEach(function(rb) {\nrb.addEventListener(\"change\", function() {\n    var correct = rb.value == 4;\n    var msgBox = document.getElementById('14318082245935350206_message');\n      if(correct) {\n    msgBox.innerHTML = \"<div class='pluto-output admonition note alert alert-success'><span> 👍&nbsp;

The latter, as we can easily deflate the polynomial by dividing by $x$ if $p_0$ is zero.\n\n\nLet `var(p)` be the number of sign changes and `pos(p)` the number of positive real roots of `p`.\n\n\nFirst: For a monic $p$ if  $p_0 < 0$ then `var(p)` is odd and if $p_0 > 0$ then `var(p)` is even.\n\n\nThis is true for degree $n=1$ the two sign patterns under the assumption are `+-` ($p_0 < 0$) or `++` ($p_0 > 0$). If it is true for degree $n-1$, then the we can consider the sign pattern of such an $n$ degree polynomial having one of these patterns: `+...+-` or `+...--` (if $p_0 < 0$) or `+...++` or `+...-+` if ($p_0>0$). An induction step applied to all but the last sign for these four patterns leads to even, odd, even, odd as the number of sign changes. Incorporating the last sign leads to odd, odd, even, even as the number of sign changes.\n\n\nSecond: For a monic $p$ if `p_0 < 0` then `pos(p)` is *odd*, if `p_0 > 0` then `pos(p)` is even.\n\n\nThis is clearly true for **monic** degree $1$ polynomials: if $c$ is positive $p = x - c$ has one real root (an odd number) and $p = x + c$ has $0$ real roots (an even number). Now, suppose $p$ has degree $n$ and is monic. Then as $x$ goes to $\\infty$, it must be $p$ goes to $\\infty$.\n\n\nIf $p_0 < 0$ then there must be a positive real root, say $r$, (Bolzano's intermediate value theorem). Dividing $p$ by $(x-r)$ to produce $q$ requires $q_0$ to be *positive* and of lower degree. By *induction* $q$ will have an even number of roots. Add in the root $r$ to see that $p$ will have an **odd** number of roots.\n\n\nNow consider the case $p_0 > 0$. There are two possibilities either `pos(p)` is zero or positive. If `pos(p)` is $0$ then there are an even number of roots. If `pos(p)` is positive, then call $r$ one of the real positive roots. Again divide by $x-r$ to produce $p = (x-r) \\cdot q$. Then $q_0$ must be *negative* for $p_0$ to be positive. By *induction* $q$ must have an odd number or roots, meaning $p$ must have an even numbers\n\n\nSo there is parity between `var(p)` and `pos(p)`: if $p$ is monic and $p_0 < 0$ then both `var(p)` and `pos(p)` are both odd; and if $p_0 > 0$ both `var(p)` and `pos(p)` are both even.\n\n\nDescartes' rule of signs will be established if it can be shown that `var(p)` is at least as big as `pos(p)`. Supppose $r$ is a positive real root of $p$ with $p = (x-r)q$. We show that `var(p) > var(q)` which can be repeatedly applied to show that if $p=(x-r_1)\\cdot(x-r_2)\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (x-r_l) q$, where the $r_i$s are the postive real roots, then `var(p) >= l + var(q) >= l = pos(p)`.\n\n\nAs $p = (x-c)q$ we must have the leading term is $p_nx^n = x \\cdot q_{n-1} x^{n-1}$ so $q_{n_1}$ will also be `+` under our monic assumption. Looking at a possible pattern for the signs of $q$, we might see the following unfinished synthetic division table for a specific $q$:\n\n\n\n```{verbatim}\n  + ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n+   ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n  -----------------\n  + - - - + - + + 0\n```\n\n\nBut actually, we can fill in more, as the second row is formed by multiplying a postive $c$:\n\n\n\n```{verbatim}\n  + ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n+   + - - - + - + +\n  -----------------\n  + - - - + - + + 0\n```\n\n\nWhat's more, using the fact that to get `0` the two summands must differ in sign and to have a `?` plus `+` yield a `-`, the `?` must be `-` (and reverse), the following must be the case for the signs of `p`:\n\n\n\n```{verbatim}\n  + - ? ? + - + ? -\n+   + - - - + - + +\n  -----------------\n  + - - - + - + + 0\n```\n\n\nIf the bottom row represents $q_7, q_6, \\dots, q_0$  and the top row $p_8, p_7, \\dots, p_0$, then the sign changes in $q$ from `+` to `-` are matched by sign changes in $p$. The ones in $q$ from $-$ to $+$ are also matched regardless of the sign of the first two question marks (though $p$ could possibly have more). The last sign change in $p$ between $p_2$ and $p_0$ has no counterpart in $q$, so there is at least one more sign change in $p$ than $q$.\n\n\nAs such, the `var(p)` $\\geq 1 +$ `var(q)`.\n\n",
