Consider a bounded function $f$ over $[a,b]$.  A partition, $P$, is based on $a = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_n = b$. For each subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]$ take $m_i(f) = \\inf_{u \\text{ in } [x_{i-1},x_i]} f(u)$ and $M_i(f) = \\sup_{u \\text{ in } [x_{i-1},x_i]} f(u)$. (When $f$ is continuous, $m_i$ and $M_i$ are realized at points of $[x_{i-1},x_i]$, though that isn't assumed here. The use of \"$\\sup$\" and \"$\\inf$\" is a mathematically formal means to replace this in general.) Let $\\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$. Form the sums $m(f, P) = \\sum_i m_i(f) \\Delta x_i$ and $M(f, P) = \\sum_i M_i(f) \\Delta x_i$. These are the *lower* and *upper* Riemann sums for a partition. A general Riemann sum would be formed by selecting $c_i$ from $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ and forming $S(f,P) = \\sum f(c_i) \\Delta x_i$. It will be the case that $m(f,P) \\leq S(f,P) \\leq M(f,P)$, as this is true for *each* sub-interval of the partition.\n\n\nIf, as the largest diameter ($\\Delta x_i$) of the partition $P$ goes to $0$, the upper and lower sums converge to the same limit, then $f$ is called Riemann integrable over $[a,b]$. If $f$ is Riemann integrable, any Riemann sum will converge to the definite integral as the partitioning shrinks.\n\n\nContinuous functions are known to be Riemann integrable, as are functions with only finitely many discontinuities, though this isn't the most general case of integrable functions, which will be stated below.\n\n\nIn practice, we don't typically compute integrals using a limit of a partition, though the approach may provide direction to numeric answers, as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates the definite integral with an antiderivative of the integrand.\n\n\nThe multidimensional case will prove to be similar where a Riemann sum is used to define the value being discussed, but a theorem of Fubini will allow the computation of integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\n\n---\n\n## Integration theory\n\n![How to estimate the volume contained within the Chrysler Building? One way might be to break the building up into tall vertical blocks based on its skyline;  compute the volume of each block using the formula of volume as area of the base times the height; and, finally, adding up the computed volumes This is the basic idea of finding volumes under surfaces using Riemann integration.](../integral_vector_calculus/figures/chrysler-building-in-new-york.jpg)\n\n\n\n![Computing the volume of a nano-block construction of the Chrysler building is easier than trying to find an actual tree at the Chrysler building, as we can easily compute the volume of columns of equal-sized blocks. Riemann sums are similar. ](../integral_vector_calculus/figures/chrysler-nano-block.png)\n\n\n\nThe definition of the  multi-dimensional integral is more involved then the one-dimensional case due to the possibly increased complexity of the region. This will require additional [steps](https://math.okstate.edu/people/lebl/osu4153-s16/chapter10-ver1.pdf). The basic approach is as follows.\n\n\nFirst, let $R = [a_1, b_1] \\times [a_2, b_2] \\times \\cdots \\times [a_n, b_n]$ be a closed rectangular region. If $n=2$, this is a rectangle, and if $n=3$, a box. We begin by defining integration over closed rectangular regions. For each side, a partition $P_i$ is chosen based on $a_i = x_{i0} < x_{i1} < \\cdots < x_{ik} = b_i$. Then a sub-rectangular region would be of the form $R' = P_{1j_1} \\times P_{2j_2} \\times \\cdots \\times P_{nj_n}$, where $P_{ij_i}$ is one of the partitioning sub intervals of $[a_i, b_i]$. Set $\\Delta R' = \\Delta P_{1j_1} \\cdot \\Delta P_{2j_2} \\cdot\\cdots\\cdot\\Delta P_{nj_n}$ to be the $n$-dimensional volume of the sub-rectangular region.\n\n\nFor each sub-rectangular region, we can define $m(f,R')$ to be $\\inf_{u \\text{ in } R'} f(u)$ and $M(f, R') = \\sup_{u \\text{ in } R'} f(u)$. If we enumerate all the sub-rectangular regions, we can define $m(f, P) = \\sum_i m(f, R_i) \\Delta R_i$ and $M(f,P) = \\sum_i M(f, R_i)\\Delta R_i$, as in the one-dimensional case. These are upper and lower sums, and, as before, would bound the Riemann sum formed by choosing any $c_i$ in $R_i$ and computing $S(f,P) = \\sum_i f(c_i) \\Delta R_i$.\n\n\nAs with the one-dimensional case, $f$ is Riemann integrable over $R$ if the limits of $m(f,P)$ and $M(f,P)$ exist and are identical as the diameter of the partition (defined as the largest diameter of each side) goes to $0$. If the limits are equal, then so is the limit of any Riemann sum.\n\n\nWhen $f$ is Riemann integrable over a rectangular region $R$, we denote the limit by any of:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R f(x) dV, \\quad \\iint_R fdV, \\quad \\iint_R f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) dx_1 \\cdot\\cdots\\cdot dx_n, \\quad\\iint_R f(\\vec{x}) d\\vec{x}.\n$$\n\n\nA key fact, requiring proof, is:\n\n\n> Any continuous function, $f$, is Riemann integrable over a closed, bounded rectangular region.\n\n---\n\n\nAs with one-dimensional integrals, from the Riemann sum definition, several familiar properties for integrals follow. Let $V(R)$ be the volume of $R$ found by multiplying the side-lengths together.\n\n\n**Constants:**\n\n\n  * A constant is Riemann integrable and: $\\iint_R c dV = c V(R)$.\n\n\n**Linearity:**\n\n\n  * For integrable $f$ and $g$ and constants $a$ and $b$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R (af(x) + bg(x))dV = a\\iint_R f(x)dV + b\\iint_R g(x) dV.\n$$\n\n\n**Disjoint:**\n\n\n  * If $R$ and $R'$ are *disjoint* rectangular regions (possibly sharing a boundary), then the integral over the union is defined by linearity:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_{R \\cup R'} f(x) dV = \\iint_R f(x)dV + \\iint_{R'} f(x) dV.\n$$\n\n\n**Monotonicity:**\n\n\n  * As $f$ is bounded, let $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x$ in $R$.

The `hcubature` function is defined for $n$-dimensional integrals, so the integrand is specified through a function which takes a vector as an input. The region to integrate over is of rectangular form. It is specified by a tuple of left endpoints and a tuple of right endpoints. The order is in terms of the order of the vector.\n\n\nTo elaborate, if we think of $f(\\vec{x}) = f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ and we are integrating over $[a_1, b_1] \\times \\cdots \\times [a_n, b_n]$, then the region would be specified through two tuples: `(a1, a2, ..., an)` and `(b1, b2, ..., bn)`.\n\n\nTo illustrate, to integrate the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$ over the region $[0,1] \\times [0,2]$ using `HCubature`'s `hcubature` function, we would proceed as follows:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2\nf(v) = f(v...)  # f accepts a vector\na0, b0 = 0, 1\na1, b1 = 0, 2\nhcubature(f, (a0, a1), (b0, b1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n(14.0, 1.7763568394002505e-15)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe computed value and a worst case estimate for the error is returned, in a manner similar to the `quadgk` function (from the `QuadGK` package) used previously for one-dimensional numeric integrals.\n\n\nThe order above is `x` then `y`, which is clear from the first definition of `f` and as belabored in the tuples passed to `hcubature`. A more convenient use is to just put the constants into the function call, as in `hcubature(f, (0,0), (1,2))`.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nLet's verify the numeric approach works for figures where an answer is known from the geometry of the problem.\n\n\n  * A constant function $c=f(x,y)$. In this case, the volume is simply a box, so the volume will come from multiplying the three dimensions. Here is an example:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=7}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = 3\nf(v) = f(v...)\na0, b0 = 0, 4\na1, b1 = 0, 5  # R is area 20, so V = 60 = 3 ⋅ 20\nhcubature(f, (a0, a1), (b0, b1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```\n(60.0, 7.105427357601002e-15)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n  * A wedge. Let $f(x,y) = x$ and $R= [0,1] \\times [0,1]$. The the volume is a wedge, and should be half the value of the unit cube, or simply $1/2$:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=8}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = x\nf(v) = f(v...)\na0, b0 = 0, 1\na1, b1 = 0, 1\nhcubature(f, (a0, a1), (b0, b1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```\n(0.5, 0.0)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n  * The volume of a right square pyramid is $V=(1/3)a^2 h$, or a third of an enclosing box. We computed this area previously using the method of [slices](../integrals/volumes_slice.html). Here we do it thinking of the pyramid as the volume formed by the surface over the region $[-a,a] \\times [-a,a]$ generated by $f(x,y) = h \\cdot (l(x,y) - d(x,y))/l(x,y)$ where $d(x,y)$ is the distance to the origin, or $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $l(x,y)$ is the length of the line segment from the origin to the boundary of $R$ that goes through $(x,y)$.\n\n\nIdentifying a formula for this is a bit tricky. Here we use a brute force approach; later we will simplify this. Using polar coordinates, we know $r\\cos(\\theta) = a$ describes the line $x=a$ and $r\\sin(\\theta)=a$ describes the line $y=a$. Using the square, we have to alternate between these depending on where $\\theta$ is (e.g., between $-\\pi/4$ and $\\pi/4$ it would be $r\\cos(\\theta)=a$ or $a/\\cos(\\theta)$ is $l(x,y)$. We write a function for this:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n𝒅(x, y)  = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\nfunction 𝒍(x, y, a)\n    theta = atan(y,x)\n    atheta = abs(theta)\n    if (pi/4 <= atheta < 3pi/4) # this is the y=a or y=-a case\n        (a/2)/sin(atheta)\n    else\n        (a/2)/abs(cos(atheta))\n    end\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n𝒍 (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd then\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n𝒇(x,y,a,h) = h * (𝒍(x,y,a) - 𝒅(x,y))/𝒍(x,y,a)\n𝒂, 𝒉 = 2, 3\n𝒇(x,y) = 𝒇(x, y, 𝒂, 𝒉)   # fix a and h\n𝒇(v) = 𝒇(v...)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```\n𝒇 (generic function with 3 methods)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can visualize the volume to be computed, as follows:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=11}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nxs = ys = range(-1, 1, length=20)\nsurface(xs, ys, 𝒇)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n![](double_triple_integrals_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTrying this, we have:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nhcubature(𝒇, (-𝒂/2, -𝒂/2), (𝒂/2, 𝒂/2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```\n(4.000000009419327, 5.9590510310780554e-8)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe answer agrees with that known from the  formula, $4 = (1/3)a^2 h$, but the answer takes a long time to be produce. The `hcubature` function is  slow with functions defined in terms of conditions. For this problem, volumes by [slicing](../integrals/volumes_slice.html) is more direct. But also symmetry can be used, were we able to compute the volume above the triangular region formed by the $x$-axis, the line $x=a/2$ and the line $y=x$, which would be $1/8$th the total volume. (As then $l(x,y,a) = (a/2)/\\sin(\\tan^{-1}(y,x))$.).\n\n\n  * The volume of a sphere is $4/3 \\pi r^3$. We could verify this by integrating $z = f(x,y) = \\sqrt{r^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}$ over $R = \\{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 \\leq r^2\\}$. *However*, this is not a *rectangular* region, so we couldn't directly proceed.\n\n\nWe might try integrating a function with a condition:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=13}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction f(x, y, r)\n    if x^2 + y^2 < r\n        sqrt(z - x^2 + y^2)\n    else\n        0.0\n    end\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\nf (generic function with 3 methods)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**But** `hcubature` is **very** slow to integrate such functions. We will see our instincts are good – this is the approach taken to discuss integrals over general regions – but this is not practical here. There are two alternative approaches to be discussed: approach the integral *iteratively*  or *transform* the circular region into a rectangular region and integrate. Before doing so, we discuss how the integral is developed for more general regions.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nThe approach above takes a nice smooth function and makes it non smooth at the boundary. In general this is not a good idea for numeric solutions, as many algorithms work better with assumptions of smoothness.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nThe `Quadrature` package provides a uniform interface for `QuadGK`, `HCubature`, and other numeric integration routines available in `Julia`.\n\n:::\n\n## Integrals over more general regions\n\n\nTo proceed further, it is necessary to discuss certain types of sets that will be used to describe the boundaries of regions that can be integrated over, though we don't dig into the details.\n\n\nLet the *measure* of a rectangular region be its volume and for any subset of $S \\subset R^n$, define the *outer* measure of $S$ by $m^*(S) = \\inf\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty V(R_j)$ where the infimum is taken over all closed, countable, rectangles with $S \\subset \\cup_{j=1}^\\infty R_j$.\n\n\nIn two dimensions, if $S$ is viewed on a grid, then this would be *area* of the smallest collection of cells that contain any part of $S$. This is the smallest this value takes as the grid becomes infinite.\n\n\nFor the following graph, there are $100$ cells each of area $8/100$. Their are 58 cells covering the curve and its interior. So the outer measure is less than $58\\cdot 8/100$, as this is just one possible covering.\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=14}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n![](double_triple_integrals_files/figure-html/cell-15-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA set has measure $0$ if the outer measure is $0$. An alternate definition, among other characterizations, is a set has measure $0$ if for any $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists rectangular regions $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_n$ (for some $n$) with $\\sum V(R_i) < \\epsilon$. Measure zero sets have many properties not discussed here.\n\n\nFor now, let's see that graph of $y=f(x)$ over $[a,b]$, as a two dimensional set, has measure zero when $f(x)$ has a bounded derivative ($|f'|$ bounded by $M$). Fix some $\\epsilon>0$. Take $n$ with $2M(b-a)^2/n < \\epsilon$, then divide $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal length intervals (of length $\\delta = (b-a)/n)$. For each interval, we consider the box $[a_i, b_i] \\times [f(a_i)-\\delta M, f(a_i) + \\delta M]$. By the mean value theorem, we have $|f(x) - f(a_i)| \\leq |b_i-a_i|M$ so $f(a_i) - \\delta M \\leq f(x) \\leq f(a_i) + \\delta M$, so the curve will stay in the boxes. These boxes have total area $n \\cdot \\delta \\cdot 2\\delta M = 2M(b-a)^2/n$, an area less than $\\epsilon$.\n\n\nThe above can be extended to any graph of a continuous function over $[a,b]$.\n\n\nFor a function $f$ the set of discontinuities in $R$ is all points where $f$ is not continuous. A formal definition is often given in terms of oscillation. Let $o(f, \\vec{x}, \\delta) = \\sup_{\\{\\vec{y} : \\| \\vec{y}-\\vec{x}\\| < \\delta\\}}f(\\vec{y}) - \\inf_{\\{\\vec{y}: \\|\\vec{y}-\\vec{x}\\|<\\delta\\}}f(\\vec{y})$. A function is discontinuous at $\\vec{x}$ if the limit as $\\delta \\rightarrow 0+$ (which must exist) is not $0$.\n\n\nWith this, we can state the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem on integrable functions:\n\n\n> Let $R$ be a closed, rectangular region, and $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$ a bounded function. Then $f$ is Riemann integrable over $R$ if and only if the set of discontinuities is a set of measure $0$.\n\n\n\nIt was said at the outset we would generalize the regions we can integrate over, but this theorem generalizes the functions. We can tie the two together as follows. Define the integral over any *bounded* set $S$ with boundary of measure $0$. Bounded means $S$ is contained in some bounded rectangle $R$. Let $f$ be defined on $S$ and extend it to be $0$ on points in $R$ that are not in $S$. If this extended function is integrable over $R$, then we can define the integral over $S$ in terms of that. This is why the *boundary* of $S$ must have measure zero, as in general it is among the set of discontinuities of the extend function $f$. Such regions are also called Jordan regions.\n\n\n## Fubini's theorem\n\n\nConsider again this figure\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=15}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n![](double_triple_integrals_files/figure-html/cell-16-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet $C_i$ enumerate all the cells shown,  assume $f$ is extended to be $0$ outside the region,  and let $c_i$ be a point in the cell. Then the Riemann sum $\\sum_i f(c_i) V(C_i)$ can be visualized three identical ways:\n\n\n  * as a linear sum over the indices $i$, as written, leading to $\\iint_R f(x) dV$.\n  * by indexing the cells by row ($i$) and column ($j$) and summing as $\\sum_i (\\sum_j f(x_{ij}, y_{ij}) \\Delta y_j) \\Delta x_i$.\n  * by indexing the cells by row ($i$) and column ($j$) and summing as $\\sum_j (\\sum_i f(x_{ij}, y_{ij}) \\Delta x_i) \\Delta y_j$.\n\n\nThe last two suggest that their limit will be *iterated* integrals of the form $\\int_{-1}^1 (\\int_{-2}^2 f(x,y) dy) dx$ and $\\int_{-2}^2 (\\int_{-1}^1 f(x,y) dx) dy$.\n\n\nBy \"iterated\" we mean performing two different definite integrals. For example, to compute $\\int_{-1}^1 (\\int_{-2}^2 f(x,y) dy) dx$ the first task would be to compute $I(x) =  \\int_{-2}^2 f(x,y) dy$. Like partial derivatives, this integrates in $y$ while treating $x$ as a constant. Once the interior integral is computed, then the integral $\\int_{-1}^1 I(x) dx$ would be computed to find the answer.\n\n\nThe question then: under what conditions will the three integrals be equal?\n\n\n> [Fubini](https://math.okstate.edu/people/lebl/osu4153-s16/chapter10-ver1.pdf). Let $R \\times S$ be a closed rectangular region in $R^n \\times R^m$. Suppose $f$ is bounded. Define $f_x(y) = f(x,y)$ and $f^y(x) = f(x,y)$ where $x$ is in $R^n$ and $y$ in $R^m$.  *If* $f_x$ and $f^y$ are integrable then\n>\n> $$\n> \\iint_{R\\times S}fdV = \\iint_R \\left(\\iint_S f_x(y) dy\\right) dx\n> = \\iint_S \\left(\\iint_R f^y(x) dx\\right) dy.\n> $$\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if $f^y$ is integrable for all $y$, then $\\iint_{R\\times S}fdV =\\iint_S \\iint_R f(x,y) dx dy$.\n\n\nAn immediate corollary is that the above holds for continuous functions when $R$ and $S$ are bounded, the case described here.\n\n\nThe case of continuous functions was known to [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem#History), Lebesgue (1904) discussed bounded functions, as in our statement, and Fubini and Tonnelli (1907 and 1909) generalized the statement to more general functions than continuous functions, thereby earning naming rights.\n\n\nIn [Ferzola](https://doi.org/10.2307/2687130) we can read a summary of Euler's thinking of 1769 when trying to understand the integral of a function $f(x,y)$ over a bounded domain $R$ enclosed by arcs in the $x$-$y$ plane. (That is, the area below $g(x)$ and above $h(x)$ over the interval $[a,b]$.) Euler wrote the answer as $\\int_a^b dx (\\int_{g(x)}^{h(x)} f(x,y)dy)$. Ferzola writes that Euler saw this integral yielding a *volume* as the integral $\\int_{g(x)}^{h(x)} f(x,y)dy$ gives the area of a slice (parallel to the $y$ axis) and integrating in $x$ adds these slices to give a volume. This is the typical usage of Fubini's theorem today.\n\n![Figure 14.2 of Strang illustrating the slice when either $x$ is fixed or $y$ is fixed. The inner integral computes the shared area, the outer integral adds the areas up to compute volume.](../integral_vector_calculus/figures/strang-slicing.png)\n\n\n\nIn [Volumes](../integrals/volumes_slice.html) the formula for a volume with a known cross-sectional area is given by $V = \\int_a^b CA(x) dx$. The inner integral, $\\int_{R_x} f(x,y) dy$ is a function depending on $x$ that yields the area of the slice (where $R_x$ is the region sliced by the line of constant $x$ value). This is consistent with Euler's view of the iterated integral.\n\n\nA domain, as described above, is known as a [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integral#Normal_domains_on_R2) domain. Using Fubini's theorem to integrate iteratively, employing the fundamental theorem of calculus at each step, is the standard approach.\n\n\nFor example, we return to the problem of a square pyramid, only now using symmetry, we integrate only over the triangular region between $0 \\leq x \\leq a/2$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq x$. The answer is then (the $8$ by symmetry)\n\n\n\n$$\nV = 8 \\int_0^{a/2} \\int_0^x h(l(x,y) - d(x,y))/l(x,y) dy dx.\n$$\n\n\nBut, using similar triangles, we have $d/x = l/(a/2)$ so $(l-d)/l = 1 - 2x/a$. Continuing, our answer becomes\n\n\n\n$$\nV = 8 \\int_0^{a/2} (\\int_0^x h(1-\\frac{2x}{a}) dy) dx =\n8 \\int_0^{a/2} (h(1-2x/a) \\cdot x) dx =\n8 (hx^2_2 \\big\\lvert_{0}^{a/2} - \\frac{2}{a}\\frac{x^3}{3}\\big\\lvert_0^{a/2})=\n8 h(\\frac{a^2}{8} - \\frac{2}{24}a^2) = \\frac{a^2h}{3}.\n$$\n\n\n### `SymPy`'s `integrate`\n\n\nThe `integrate` function of `SymPy` uses various algorithms to symbolically integrate definite (and indefinite) integrals. In the section on [integrals](../integrals/ftc.html) its use for one-dimensional integrals was shown. For multi-dimensional integrals the usage is similar, the syntax following, somewhat, the Fubini-like notation.\n\n\nFor example, to perform the integral\n\n\n\n$$\n\\int_a^b \\int_{h(x)}^{g(x)} f(x,y) dy dx\n$$\n\n\nthe call would look like:\n\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nintegrate(f(x,y), (y, h(x), g(x)), (x, a, b))\n```\n\n\nThat is, the variable to integrate and the endpoints are passed as tuples. (Unlike `hcubature` which always uses two tuples to specify the bounds, `integrate` uses $n$ tuples to specify an $n$-dimensional integral.) The iteration happens from left to write, so in the above the `y` integral is done (and, as seen, may depend on the variable `x`) and then the `x` integral is performed.

We will return to this when spherical coordinates are defined.\n\n\n## Change of variables\n\n\nThe change of variables, or substitution, formula from first-semester calculus is expressed, under assumptions, by:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\int_{g(R)} f(x) dx = \\int_R (f\\circ g)(u)g'(u) du.\n$$\n\n\nThe derivation comes from reversing the chain rule. When using it, we start on the right hand side and typically write $x = g(u)$ and from here derive an expression involving differentials: $dx = g'(u) du$ and the rest follows. In practice, this is used to simplify the integrand in the search for an antiderivative, as $(f\\circ g)$ is generally more complicated than $f$ alone.\n\n\nIn higher dimensions, we will see that change of variables can not only simplify the integrand, but is also of great use to simplify the region to integrate over. We mentioned, for example, that to use `hcubature` efficiently over a non-rectangular region, a transformation–-or change of variables–-is needed. The key to the multi-dimensional formula is understanding what should replace $dx = g'(u) du$. We take a bit of a circuitous route to get there.\n\n\nIn [Katz](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2689856) a review of the history of \"change of variables\" from Euler to Cartan is given. We follow Lagrange's formal analysis to derive the change of variable formula in two dimensions.\n\n\nWe view $R$ in two coordinate systems $(x,y)$ and $(u,v)$. We have that\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\ndx &= A du + B dv\\\\\ndy &= C du + D dv,\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nwhere $A = \\partial{x}/\\partial{u}$, $B = \\partial{x}/\\partial{v}$, $C= \\partial{y}/\\partial{u}$, and $D = \\partial{y}/\\partial{v}$. Lagrange, following Euler, first sets $x$ to be constant (as is done in iterated integration). Hence, $dx = 0$ and so $du = -C(B/A) dv$ and, after substitution,  $dy = (D-C(B/A))dv$. Then Lagrange set $y$ to be a constant, so $dy = 0$ and hence $dv=0$ so $dx = Adu$. The area \"element\" $dx dy = A du \\cdot (D - (B/A)) dv = (AD - BC) du dv$. Since areas and volumes are non-negative, the absolute value is used. With this, we have \"$dxdy = |AD-BC|du dv$\" as the analog of $dx = g'(u) du$.\n\n\nThe expression $AD - BC$ was also derived by Euler, by related means. Lagrange extended the analysis to 3 dimensions. Before doing so, it is helpful to understand the problem from a geometric perspective. Euler was attempting to understand the effects of the following change of variable:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nx &= a + mt + \\sqrt{1-m^2} v\\\\\ny & = b + \\sqrt{1-m^2}t -mv\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nEuler knew this to be a clockwise *rotation* by an angle $\\theta$ with $\\cos(\\theta) = m$,  a *reflection* through the $x$ axis, and a translation by $\\langle a, b\\rangle$. All these *should* preserve the area represented by $dx dy$, so he was *expecting* $dx dy = dt dv$.\n\n![Figure from Katz showing rotation of Euler.](../integral_vector_calculus/figures/euler-rotation.png)\n\n\n\nThe figure, taken from Katz, shows the translation, and rotation that should preserve area on a differential scale.\n\n\nHowever Euler knew $dx = (\\partial{g_1}/\\partial{t}) dt + (\\partial{g_1}/\\partial{v}) dv$ and $dy = (\\partial{g_2}/{\\partial{t}}) dt + (\\partial{g_2}/\\partial{v}) dv$. Just multiplying gives $dx dy = m\\sqrt{1-m^2} dt dt + (1-m^2) dv dt -m^2 dt dv -m\\sqrt{1-m^2} dv dv$, a result that didn't make sense physically as $dt dt$ and $dv dv$ have no meaning in integration and $1 - m^2 - m^2$ is not $1$ as expected. Euler, like Lagrange, used a formal trick to proceed, but the geometric insight that the incremental areas for a change of variable should be related and for this change of variable identical is correct.\n\n\nThe following illustrates the polar-coordinate transformation $\\langle x,y\\rangle = G(r, \\theta) = r \\langle \\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta\\rangle$.\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=43}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nG(u, v) = u * [cos(v), sin(v)]\n\nG(v) = G(v...)\nJ(v) = ForwardDiff.jacobian(G, v)  # [∇g1', ∇g2']\n\nn = 6\nus = range(0, 1, length=3n)     # radius\nvs = range(0, 2pi, length=3n)   # angle\n\nplot(unzip(G.(us', vs))..., legend = false, aspect_ratio=:equal)  # plots constant u lines\nplot!(unzip(G.(us, vs'))...)                                      # plots constant v lines\n\npt = [us[n],vs[n]]\n\n\narrow!(G(pt), J(pt)*[1,0], color=:blue)\narrow!(G(pt), J(pt)*[0,1], color=:blue)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=43}\n![](double_triple_integrals_files/figure-html/cell-44-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graphic shows the image of the box $[0,1] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ under the transformation.

This formula can be derived as follows. Consider a region $R$ parameterized in polar coordinates by $r(\\theta)$ for $a \\leq \\theta \\leq b$. The area of this region would be $\\iint_R fdA$.

A transformation is:\n\n\n\n$$\nG(r,\\theta, z) = \\langle r\\cos(\\theta), r\\sin(\\theta), z\\rangle.\n$$\n\n\nThis has Jacobian determinant $r$, similar to polar coordinates.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nReturning to the volume of a cone above the $x$-$y$ plane under $z = a - b(x^2 + y^2)^{12}$. This yielded the integral in Cartesian coordinates:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\int_{x=-r}^r \\int_{y=-\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}}^{\\sqrt{r^2-x^2}} \\int_0^{a - b(x^2 + y^2)} 1 dz dy dx,\n$$\n\n\nwhere $r=a/b$. This is *much* simpler in Cylindrical coordinates, as the region is described by the rectangle in $(r, \\theta)$: $[0, \\sqrt{b/a}] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ and the $z$ range is from $0$ to $a - b r$.\n\n\nThe volume then is:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\int_{theta=0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{r=0}^{a/b} \\int_{z=0}^{a - br} 1 r dz dr d\\theta =\n2\\pi \\int_{r=0}^{a/b} (a-br)r dr = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{3b^2}.\n$$\n\n\nThis is in agreement with $\\pi r^2 h/3$.\n\n\n---\n\nFind the centroid for the cone. First in the $x$ direction, $\\iint_R x dV$ is found by:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=61}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms r theta z a b\nf(x,y,z) = x\nx = r*cos(theta)\ny = r*sin(theta)\nJac = r\nintegrate(f(x,y,z) * Jac, (z, 0, a - b*r), (r, 0, a/b), (theta, 0, 2PI))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=61}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n0\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat this is $0$ is no surprise. The same will be true for the $y$ direction, as the figure is symmetric about the plane $y=0$ and $x=0$. However, the $z$ direction is different:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=62}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms r theta z a b\nf(x,y,z) = z\nx = r*cos(theta)\ny = r*sin(theta)\nJac = r\nA = integrate(f(x,y,z) * Jac, (z, 0, a - b*r), (r, 0, a/b), (theta, 0, 2PI))\nB = integrate(1 * Jac, (z, 0, a - b*r), (r, 0, a/b), (theta, 0, 2PI))\nA, B, A/B\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=62}\n```\n(pi*a^4/(12*b^2), pi*a^3/(3*b^2), a/4)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe answer depends on the height through $a$, but *not* the size of the base, parameterized by $b$. To finish, the centroid is $\\langle 0, 0, a/4\\rangle$.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nA sphere of radius $2$ is intersected by a cylinder of radius $1$ along the $z$ axis. Find the volume of the intersection.\n\n\nWe have $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ or $z^2 = 4 - r^2$ in cylindrical coordinates. The integral then is:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=63}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms r::real theta::real z::real\nintegrate(1 * r, (z, -sqrt(4-r^2), sqrt(4-r^2)), (r, 0, 1), (theta, 0, 2PI))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=63}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n2 \\pi \\left(\\frac{16}{3} - 2 \\sqrt{3}\\right)\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf instead of a fixed radius of $1$ we use $0 \\leq a \\leq 2$ we have:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=64}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms a r theta\nintegrate(1 * r, (z, -sqrt(4-r^2), sqrt(4-r^2)), (r, 0, a), (theta,0, 2PI))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=64}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n2 \\pi \\left(\\frac{2 a^{2} \\sqrt{4 - a^{2}}}{3} - \\frac{8 \\sqrt{4 - a^{2}}}{3} + \\frac{16}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Spherical integrals\n\n\nSpherical coordinates describe a point in space by a radius from the origin, $r$ or $\\rho$; a azimuthal angle $\\theta$ in $[0, 2\\pi]$ and an *inclination* angle $\\phi$ (also called polar angle) in $[0, \\pi]$. The $z$ axis is the direction of the zenith and gives a reference line to define the inclination angle. The $x$-$y$ plane is the reference plane, with the $x$ axis giving a reference direction for the azimuth measurement.\n\n\nThe exact formula to relate $(\\rho, \\theta, \\phi)$ to $(x,y,z)$ is given by\n\n\n\n$$\nG(\\rho, \\theta, \\phi) = \\rho \\langle\n\\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta),\n\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta),\n\\cos(\\phi)\n\\rangle.\n$$\n\n![Figure showing the parameterization by spherical coordinates.

Using $r^2\\sin(\\phi)$ as the multiplying factor, the volume is simply:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\theta=0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{\\phi=0}^{\\pi} \\int_{r=0}^R 1 \\cdot r^2 \\sin(\\phi) dr d\\phi d\\theta =\n\\int_{\\theta=0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{\\phi=0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\phi)d\\phi \\int_{r=0}^R  r^2 dr = (2\\pi)(2)\\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}.\n$$\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nCompute the volume of the ellipsoid, $R$, described by $(x/a)^2 + (y/v)^2 + (z/c)^2 \\leq 1$.\n\n\nWe first change variables via $G(u,v,w) = \\langle ua, vb, wc \\rangle$. This maps the unit sphere, $S$, given by $u^2 + v^2 + w^2 \\leq 1$ into the ellipsoid. Then\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R 1 dV = \\iint_S 1 |\\det(J_G)| dU\n$$\n\n\nBut the Jacobian is a constant:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=67}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms u v w a b c\nG(u,v,w) = [u*a, v*b, w*c]\ndet(G(u,v,w).jacobian([u,v,w]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=67}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\na b c\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo the answer is $abc V(S) = 4\\pi abc/3$\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n###### Question\n\n\nSuppose $f(x,y) = f_1(x)f_2(y)$ and $R = [a_1, b_1] \\times [a_2,b_2]$ is a rectangular region.
