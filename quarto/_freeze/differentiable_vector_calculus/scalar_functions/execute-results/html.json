It has multiple arguments for its input (an $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$) and only one, *scalar*, value for an output. Some simple examples might be:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nf(x,y) &= x^2 + y^2\\\\\ng(x,y) &= x \\cdot y\\\\\nh(x,y) &= \\sin(x) \\cdot \\sin(y)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nFor two examples from real life consider the elevation Point Query Service (of the [USGS](https://nationalmap.gov/epqs/)) returns the elevation in international feet or meters for a specific latitude/longitude within the United States. The longitude can be associated to an $x$ coordinate, the latitude to a $y$ coordinate, and the elevation a $z$ coordinate, and as long as the region is small enough, the $x$-$y$ coordinates can be thought to lie on a plane. (A flat earth assumption.)\n\n\nSimilarly,  a weather map, say of the United States, may show the maximum predicted temperature for a given day. This describes a function that take a position ($x$, $y$) and returns a predicted temperature ($z$).\n\n\nMathematically, we may describe the values $(x,y)$ in terms of a point, $P=(x,y)$ or a vector $\\vec{v} = \\langle x, y \\rangle$ using the identification of a point with a vector. As convenient, we may write any of $f(x,y)$, $f(P)$, or $f(\\vec{v})$ to describe the evaluation of $f$ at the value $x$ and $y$\n\n\n---\n\nReturning to the task at hand, in `Julia`, defining a scalar function is straightforward, the syntax following mathematical notation:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\ng(x,y) = x * y\nh(x,y) = sin(x) * sin(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo call a scalar function for specific values of $x$ and $y$ is also similar to the mathematical case:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(1,2), g(2, 3), h(3,4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n(5, 6, -0.10679997423758245)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt may be advantageous to have the values as a vector or a point, as in `v=[x,y]`.

Further, how to describe the change in the function between nearby values?\n\n\n## Visualizing scalar functions\n\n\nSuppose for the moment that $f:R^2 \\rightarrow R$. The equation $z = f(x,y)$ may be visualized by the set of points in $3$-dimensions $\\{(x,y,z): z = f(x,y)\\}$. This will render as a surface, and that surface will pass a \"vertical line test\", in that each $(x,y)$ value corresponds to at most one $z$ value. We will see alternatives for describing surfaces beyond through a function of the form $z=f(x,y)$. These are similar to how a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane can be described by a function of the form $y=f(x)$ but also through an equation of the form $F(x,y) = c$ or through a parametric description, such as is used for planar curves. For now though we focus on the case where $z=f(x,y)$.\n\n\nIn `Julia`, plotting such a surface requires a generalization to plotting a univariate function where, typically, a grid of evenly spaced values is given between some $a$ and $b$, the corresponding $y$ or $f(x)$ values are found, and then the points are connected in a dot-to-dot manner.\n\n\nHere, a two-dimensional grid of $x$-$y$ values needs specifying, and the corresponding $z$ values found. As the grid will be assumed to be regular only the $x$ and $y$ values need specifying, the set of pairs can be computed. The $z$ values, it will be seen, are easily computed. This cloud of points is plotted and each cell in the $x$-$y$ plane is plotted with a surface giving the $x$-$y$-$z$, $3$-dimensional, view. One way to plot such a surface is to tessalate the cell and then for each triangle, represent a plane made up of the $3$ boundary points.\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n𝒇(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n```\n𝒇 (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nxs = range(-2, 2, length=100)\nys = range(-2, 2, length=100)\n\nsurface(xs, ys, 𝒇)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-17-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `surface` function will generate the surface.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nUsing `surface` as a function name is equivalent to `plot(xs, ys, f, seriestype=:surface)`.\n\n:::\n\nWe can also use `surface(xs, ys, zs)` where `zs` is not a vector, but rather a *matrix* of values corresponding to a grid described by the `xs` and `ys`. A matrix is a rectangular collection of values indexed by row and column through indices `i` and `j`. Here the values in `zs` should satisfy: the $i$th row and $j$th column entry should be $z_{ij} = f(x_i, y_j)$ where $x_i$ is the $i$th entry from the `xs` and $y_j$ the $j$th entry from the `ys`.\n\n\nWe can generate this using a comprehension:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=17}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nzs = [𝒇(x,y) for y in ys, x in xs]\nsurface(xs, ys, zs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=18}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-18-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf remembering that the $y$ values go first, and then the $x$ values in the above is too hard, then an alternative can be used. Broadcasting `f.(xs,ys)` may not make sense, were the `xs` and `ys` not of commensurate lengths, and when it does, this call pairs off `xs` and `ys` values and passes them to `f`. What is desired here is different, where for each `xs` value there are pairs for each of the `ys` values. The syntax `xs'` can ve viewed as creating a *row* vector, where `xs` is a *column* vector. Broadcasting will create a *matrix*  of values in this case. So the following is identical to the above:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsurface(xs, ys, 𝒇.(xs', ys))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=19}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-19-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(This is still subtle. The use of the adjoint operation on `ys` will error if the dimensions are not square, but will produce an incorrect surface if not. It would be best to simply pass the function and let `Plots` handle this detail which for the alternative `Makie` is reversed.)\n\n---\n\n\nAn alternate to `surface` is `wireframe` – which may not use shading in all backenends. This displays a grid in the $x$-$y$ plane mapped to the surface:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=19}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nxs = ys = range(-2,2, length=10) # downsample to see the frame\nwireframe(xs, ys, 𝒇)   # gr() or pyplot() wireplots render better than plotly()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=20}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-20-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nThe surface $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$ has a \"saddle,\" as this shows:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=20}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = x^2 - y^2\nxs = ys = range(-2, 2, length=100)\nsurface(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=21}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-21-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nAs mentioned. In plots of univariate functions, a dot-to-dot algorithm is followed. For surfaces, the two dots are replaced by four points, which over determines a plane. Some choice is made to partition that rectangle into two triangles, and for each triangle, the $3$ resulting points determines a plane, which can be suitably rendered.\n\n\nWe can see this in the default `gr` toolkit by forcing the surface to show just one cell, as the `xs` and `ys` below only contain $2$ values:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=21}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nxs = [-1,1]; ys = [-1,1]\nf(x,y) = x*y\nsurface(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=22}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-22-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompare this, to the same region, but with many cells to represent the surface:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=22}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nxs = ys = range(-1, 1, length=100)\nf(x,y) = x*y\nsurface(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=23}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-23-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Contour plots and heatmaps\n\n\n\nConsider the example of latitude, longitude, and elevation data describing a surface. The following graph is generated from such data, which was retrieved from the USGS website for a given area. The grid points are chosen about every $150$m, so this is not too fine grained.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nSC = JSON.parse(somocon)  # defined in a hidden cell\nxsₛ, ysₛ, zsₛ =  [float.(SC[i]) for i in (\"xs\", \"ys\",\"zs\")]\nzzsₛ = reshape(zsₛ, (length(xsₛ), length(ysₛ)))' # reshape to matrix\nsurface(xsₛ, ysₛ, zzsₛ)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=26}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-26-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis shows a bit of the topography. If we look at the region from directly above, the graph looks different:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsurface(xsₛ, ysₛ, zzsₛ, camera=(0, 90))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=27}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-27-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe rendering uses different colors to indicate height. A more typical graph, that is somewhat similar to the top down view, is a *contour* map.\n\n\nFor a scalar function, Define a *level curve* as the solutions to the equations $f(x,y) = c$ for a given $c$. (Or more generally $f(\\vec{x}) = c$ for a vector if dimension $2$ or more.) Plotting a selection of level curves yields a *contour* graph. These are produced with `contour` and called as above. For example, we have:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ncontour(xsₛ, ysₛ, zzsₛ)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=28}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-28-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWere one to walk along one of the contour lines, then there would be no change in elevation. The areas of greatest change in elevation - basically the hills - occur where the different contour lines are closest. In this particular area, there is a river that runs from the upper right through to the lower left and this is flanked by hills.\n\n\nThe $c$ values for the levels drawn may be specified through the `levels` argument:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ncontour(xsₛ, ysₛ, zzsₛ, levels=[50,75,100, 125, 150, 175])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=29}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-29-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat shows the $50$m, $75$m, ... contours.\n\n\nIf a fixed number of evenly spaced levels is desirable, then the `nlevels` argument is available.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=29}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ncontour(xsₛ, ysₛ, zzsₛ, nlevels = 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=30}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-30-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf a function describes the surface, then the function may be passed as the third value:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=30}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x, y) = sin(x) - cos(y)\nxs = range(0, 2pi, length=100)\nys = range(-pi, pi, length = 100)\ncontour(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=31}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-31-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nAn informative graphic mixes both a surface plot with a contour plot. The `PyPlot` package can be used to generate one, but such graphs are not readily made within the `Plots` framework. Here is a workaround, where the contours are generated through the `Contours` package. At the beginning of this section several of its methods are imported.\n\n\nThis example shows how to add a contour at a fixed level ($0$ below). As no hidden line algorithm is used to hide the contour line if the surface were to cover it, a transparency is specified through `alpha=0.5`:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=31}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction surface_contour(xs, ys, f; offset=0)\n  p = surface(xs, ys, f, legend=false, fillalpha=0.5)\n\n  ## we add to the graphic p, then plot\n  zs = [f(x,y) for x in xs, y in ys]  # reverse order for use with Contour package\n  for cl in levels(contours(xs, ys, zs))\n    lvl = level(cl) # the z-value of this contour level\n    for line in lines(cl)\n        _xs, _ys = coordinates(line) # coordinates of this line segment\n        _zs = offset .+ (0 .* _xs)\n        plot!(p, _xs, _ys, _zs, alpha=0.5)        # add curve on x-y plane\n    end\n  end\n  p\nend\n\nxs = ys = range(-pi, stop=pi, length=100)\nf(x,y) = 2 + sin(x) - cos(y)\n\nsurface_contour(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=32}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-32-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that at the minimum of the surface, the contour lines are nested closed loops with decreasing area.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nThe figure shows a weather map from $1943$ with contour lines based on atmospheric pressure. These are also know as *isolines*.\n\n![Image from [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/unr/1943-01-22) of a contour map showing atmospheric pressures from January 22, 1943 in Rapid City, South Dakota. ](../differentiable_vector_calculus/figures/daily-map.jpg)\n\n\n\nThis day is highlighted as \"The most notable temperature fluctuations occurred on January 22, 1943 when temperatures rose and fell almost 50 degrees in a few minutes. This phenomenon was caused when a frontal boundary separating extremely cold Arctic air from warmer Pacific air rolled like an ocean tide along the northern and eastern slopes of the Black Hills.\"\n\n\nThis frontal boundary is marked with triangles and half circles along the thicker black line. The tight spacing of the contour lines above that marked line show a big change in pressure in a short distance.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nSea surface temperature varies with latitude and other factors, such as water depth. The following figure shows average temperatures for January 1982 around Australia. The filled contours allow for an easier identification of the ranges represented.\n\n![Image from [IRI](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/Global/Ocean_Temp/Monthly_Temp.html) shows mean sea surface temperature near Australia in January 1982.

The contour lines are in 2 degree Celsius increments. ](../differentiable_vector_calculus/figures/australia.png)\n\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nThe filled contour and the heatmap are related figures to a simple contour graph. The heatmap uses a color gradient to indicate the value at $(x,y)$:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=34}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/5) * sin(x) * cos(y)\nxs= ys = range(-pi, pi, length=100)\nheatmap(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=35}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-35-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe filled contour layers on the contour lines to a heatmap:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=35}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/5) * sin(x) * cos(y)\nxs= ys = range(-pi, pi, length=100)\ncontourf(xs, ys, f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=36}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-36-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis function has a prominent peak and a prominent valley, around the middle of the viewing window. The nested contour lines indicate this, and the color key can be used to identify which is the peak and which the valley.\n\n\n## Limits\n\n\nThe notion of a limit for a univariate function: as $x$ gets close to $c$ then $f(x)$ gets close to $L$, needs some modification:\n\n\n> Let $f: R^n \\rightarrow R$ and $C$ be a point in $R^n$. Then $\\lim_{P \\rightarrow C}f(P) = L$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(P) - L| < \\epsilon$ whenever $0 < \\| P - C \\| < \\delta$.\n\n\n\n(If $P=(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ we use $f(P) = f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$.)\n\n\nThis says, informally, for any scale about $L$ there is a \"ball\" about $C$ (not including $C$) for which the images of $f$ always sit in the ball. Formally we define a ball of radius $r$ about a point $C$ to be all points $P$ with distance between $P$ and $C$ less than $r$. A ball is an *open* set. An [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set#Euclidean_space) is a set $U$ such that for any $x$ in $U$, there is a radius $r$ such that the ball of radius $r$ about $x$ is *still* within $U$. An open set generalizes an open interval. A *closed* set generalizes a *closed* interval. These are [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) by a set that contains its boundary. Boundary points are any points that can be approached in the limit by points within the set.\n\n\nIn the univariate case, it can be useful to characterize a limit at $x=c$ existing if *both* the left and right limits exist and the two are equal. Generalizing to getting close in $R^m$ leads to the intuitive idea of a limit existing in terms of any continuous \"path\" that approaches $C$ in the $x$-$y$ plane has a limit and all are equal. Let $\\gamma$ describe the path, and $\\lim_{s \\rightarrow t}\\gamma(s) = C$. Then $f \\circ \\gamma$ will be a univariate function. If there is a limit, $L$, then this composition will also have the same limit as $s \\rightarrow t$. Conversely, if for *every* path this composition has the *same* limit, then $f$ will have a limit.\n\n\nThe \"two path corollary\" is a trick to show a limit does not exist - just find two paths where there is a limit, but they differ, then a limit does not exist in general.\n\n\n### Continuity of scalar functions\n\n\nContinuity is defined in a familiar manner: $f(P)$ is continuous at $C$ if $\\lim_{P \\rightarrow C} f(P) = f(C)$, where we interpret $P \\rightarrow C$ in the sense of a ball about $C$.\n\n\nAs with univariate functions continuity will be preserved under function addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (provided there is no dividing by $0$). With this, all these functions are continuous everywhere and so have limits everywhere:\n\n\n\n$$\nf(x,y) = \\sin(x + y), \\quad\ng(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, \\quad\nh(w, x,y,z) = \\sqrt{w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.\n$$\n\n\nNot all functions will have a limit though. Consider $f(x,y) = 2x^2/(x^2+y^2)$ and $C=(0,0)$. It is not defined at $C$ (dividing by $0$), but may have a limit at $C$. Consider the path $x=0$ (the $y$-axis) parameterized by $\\vec\\gamma(t) = \\langle 0, t\\rangle$. Along this path $(f\\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t) = 0/t^2 = 0$ so will have a limit of $0$. If the limit of $f$ exists it must be $0$. But, along  the line $y=0$ (the $x$ axis) parameterized by $\\vec{\\gamma}(t) = \\langle t, 0 \\rangle$, the function simplifies to $(f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)(t)=2$, so would have a limit of $2$. As the limit along different paths is different, this function has no limit in general.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nIf is not enough that a limit exist along many paths to say a limit exists in general. It must be all paths and be equal. An example might be this function:\n\n\n\n$$\nf(x,y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(x + y)/(x-y) & x \\neq y,\\\\\n0 & x = y\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nAt $\\vec{0}$ this will not have a limit. However, along any line $y=mx$ we have a limit. If $m=1$ the function is constantly $0$, and so has the limit. If $m \\neq 1$, then we get $f(x, y) = f(x, mx) = (1 + m)/(1-m)$, a constant So for each $m$ there is a different limit. Consequently, the scalar function does not have a limit.\n\n\n## Partial derivatives and the gradient\n\n\nDiscussing the behaviour of a scalar function along a path is described mathematically through composition. If $\\vec\\gamma(t)$ is a path in $R^n$, then the composition $f \\circ \\vec\\gamma$ will be a univariate function. When $n=2$, we can visualize this composition directly, or as a $3$-D path on the surface given by $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle \\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t), \\dots, \\gamma_n(t), (f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t) \\rangle$.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf₁(x,y) = 2 - x^2 - 3y^2\nf₁(x) = f₁(x...)\nγ₁(t) = 2 * [t, -t^2]   # use \\gamma[tab]\nx₁s = y₁s = range(-1, 1, length=100)\nsurface(x₁s, y₁s, f₁)\nr3₁(t) = [γ₁(t)..., f₁(γ₁(t))]  # to plot the path on the surface\nplot_parametric!(0..1/2, r3₁, linewidth=5, color=:black)\n\nr2₁(t) = [γ₁(t)..., 0]\nplot_parametric!(0..1/2, r2₁, linewidth=5, color=:black) # in the $x$-$y$ plane\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=37}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-37-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe vector valued function `r3(t) = [γ(t)..., f(γ(t))]` takes the $2$-dimensional path specified by $\\vec\\gamma(t)$ and adds a third, $x$, direction by composing the position with `f`. In this way, a $2$-D path is visualized with a $3$-D path. This viewpoint can be reversed, as desired.\n\n\nHowever, the composition,  $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma$, is a univariate function, so this can also be visualized by\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=37}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nplot(f₁ ∘ γ₁, 0, 1/2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=38}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-38-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this graph, we might be led to ask about derivatives or rates of change. For this example, we can algebraically compute the composition:\n\n\n\n$$\n(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t) = 2 - (2t) - 3(-2t^2)^2 = 2 - 2t +12t^4\n$$\n\n\nFrom here we clearly have $f'(t) = -2 + 48t^3$. But could this be computed in terms of a \"derivative\" of $f$ and the derivative of $\\vec\\gamma$?\n\n\nBefore answering this, we discuss *directional* derivatives along the simplified paths $\\vec\\gamma_x(t) = \\langle t, c\\rangle$ or $\\vec\\gamma_y(t) = \\langle c, t\\rangle$.\n\n\nIf we compose $f \\circ \\vec\\gamma_x$, we can visualize this as a curve on the surface from $f$ that moves in the $x$-$y$ plane along the line $y=c$. The derivative of this curve will satisfy:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma_x)'(x) &=\n\\lim_{t \\rightarrow x} \\frac{(f\\circ\\vec\\gamma_x)(t) - (f\\circ\\vec\\gamma_x)(x)}{t-x}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{t\\rightarrow x} \\frac{f(t, c) - f(x,c)}{t-x}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h, c) - f(x, c)}{h}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThe latter expresses this to be the derivative of the function that holds the $y$ value fixed, but lets the $x$ value vary. It is the rate of change in the $x$ direction. There is special notation for this:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} &=\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h},\\quad\\text{and analogously}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} &=\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x, y+h) - f(x, y)}{h}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThese are called the *partial* derivatives of $f$. The symbol $\\partial$, read as \"partial\", is reminiscent of \"$d$\", but indicates the derivative is only in a given direction. Other notations exist for this:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\quad f_x, \\quad \\partial_x f,\n$$\n\n\nand more generally, when $n$ may be $2$ or more,\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}, \\quad f_{x_i}, \\quad f_i, \\quad \\partial_{x_i} f, \\quad \\partial_i f.\n$$\n\n\nThe *gradient* of a scalar function $f$ is the vector comprised of the partial derivatives:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) = \\langle\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\dots,\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} \\rangle.\n$$\n\n\nAs seen, the gradient is a vector-valued function, but has, also, multivariable inputs. It is a function from $R^n \\rightarrow R^n$.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nLet $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy$, then to compute the partials, we just treat the other variables like a constant. (This is consistent with the view that the partial derivative is just a regular derivative along a line where all other variables are constant.)\n\n\nThen\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial (x^2 - 2xy)}{\\partial x} &= 2x - 2y\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (x^2 - 2xy)}{\\partial y} &= 0 - 2x = -2x.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nCombining, gives $\\nabla{f} = \\langle 2x -2y, -2x \\rangle$.\n\n\nIf $g(x,y,z) = \\sin(x) + z\\cos(y)$, then\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial x} &= \\cos(x) + 0 = \\cos(x),\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial y} &= 0 + z(-\\sin(y)) = -z\\sin(y),\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial z} &= 0 + \\cos(y) = \\cos(y).\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nCombining, gives $\\nabla{g} = \\langle \\cos(x), -z\\sin(y), \\cos(y) \\rangle$.\n\n\n### Finding partial derivatives in Julia\n\n\nTwo different methods are described, one for working with functions, the other symbolic expressions. This mirrors our treatment for vector-valued functions, where `ForwardDiff.derivative` was used for functions, and `SymPy`'s `diff` function for symbolic expressions.\n\n\nSuppose, we consider $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy$. We may define it with `Julia` through:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=38}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf₂(x,y) = x^2 - 2x*y\nf₂(v) = f₂(v...)       # to handle vectors. Need not be defined each time\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=39}\n```\nf₂ (generic function with 2 methods)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe numeric gradient at a point, can be found from the function `ForwardDiff.gradient` through:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=39}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\npt₂ = [1, 2]\nForwardDiff.gradient(f₂, pt₂)      # uses the f(v) call above\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=40}\n```\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n -2\n -2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis, of course matches the computation above, where $\\nabla f = \\langle (2x -2y, -2x)$, so at $(1,2)$ is $(-2, 2)$, as a point in $R^2$.\n\n\nThe `ForwardDiff.gradient` function expects a function that accepts a vector of values, so the method for `f(v)` is needed for the computation.\n\n\nTo go from a function that takes a point to a function of that point, we have the following definition. This takes advantage of `Julia`'s multiple dispatch to add a new method for the `gradient` generic. This is done in the `CalculusWithJulia` package along the lines of:\n\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nFowardDiff.gradient(f::Function) = x -> ForwardDiff.gradient(f, x)\n```\n\n\nIt works as follows, where a vector of values is passed in for the point in question:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=41}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngradient(f₂)([1,2]), gradient(f₂)([3,4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=41}\n```\n([-2, -2], [-2, -6])\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis expects a point or vector for its argument, and not the expanded values. Were that desired, something like this would work:\n\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nForwardDiff.gradient(f::Function) = (x, xs...) -> ForwardDiff.gradient(f, vcat(x, xs...))\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=43}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngradient(f₂)([1,2]), gradient(f₂)(3,4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=42}\n```\n([-2, -2], [-2, -6])\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the gradient, finding the partial derivatives involves extraction of the corresponding component.\n\n\nFor example, were it desirable, this function could be used to find the partial in $x$ for some constant $y$:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=44}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\npartial_x(f, y) = x -> ForwardDiff.gradient(f,[x,y])[1]   # first component of gradient\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=43}\n```\npartial_x (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother alternative would be to hold one variable constant, and use the `derivative` function, as in:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=45}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\npartial_x(f, y) = x -> ForwardDiff.derivative(u -> f(u,y), x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=44}\n```\npartial_x (generic function with 1 method)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nFor vector-valued functions, we can overide the syntax `'` using `Base.adjoint`, as `'` is treated as a postfix operator in `Julia` for the `adjoint` operation. The symbol `\\\\nabla` is also available in `Julia`, but it is not an operator, so can't be used as mathematically written `∇f` (this could be used as a name though). In `CalculusWithJulia` a definition is made so essentially `∇(f) = x -> ForwardDiff.gradient(f, x)`. It does require parentheses to be called, as in `∇(f)`.\n\n:::\n\n#### Symbolic expressions\n\n\nThe partial derivatives are more directly found with `SymPy`. As with univariate functions, the `diff` function is used by simply passing in the variable in which to find the partial derivative:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=46}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms x y\nex = x^2 - 2x*y\ndiff(ex, x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=45}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n2 x - 2 y\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd evaluation:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=47}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ndiff(ex,x)(x=>1, y=>2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=46}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n-2\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=48}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ndiff(ex, y)(x=>1, y=>2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=47}\n```{=html}\n<span class=\"math-left-align\" style=\"padding-left: 4px; width:0; float:left;\"> \n\\[\n-2\n\\]\n</span>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe gradient would be found by combining the two:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=49}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n[diff(ex, x), diff(ex, y)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=48}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n 2⋅x - 2⋅y\n      -2⋅x\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis can be simplified through broadcasting:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=50}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngrad_ex = diff.(ex, [x,y])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=49}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n 2⋅x - 2⋅y\n      -2⋅x\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo evaluate at a point we have:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=51}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nsubs.(grad_ex, x=>1, y=>2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=50}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n -2\n -2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above relies on broadcasting treating the pair as a single value so the substitution is repeated for each entry of `grad_ex`.\n\n\nThe `gradient` function from `CalculusWithJulia` is defined to find the symbolic gradient. It uses `free_symbols` to specify the number and order of the variables, but that may be wrong; they are specified below:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=52}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngradient(ex, [x, y])   # [∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=51}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n 2⋅x - 2⋅y\n      -2⋅x\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo use `∇` and specify the variables, a tuple (grouping parentheses) is used:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=53}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n∇((ex, [x,y]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=52}\n```\n2-element Vector{Sym}:\n 2⋅x - 2⋅y\n      -2⋅x\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\nIn computer science there are two related concepts [Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) and [Partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application). For a function $f(x,y)$, say, partial application is the process of fixing one of the variables, producing a new function of fewer variables. For example, fixing $y=c$, the we get a new function (of just $x$ and not $(x,y)$) $g(x) = f(x,c)$. In partial derivatives the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ is the derivative of the function $g$, as defined above.\n\n\nCurrying, is related, but technically returns a function, so we think of the curried version of $f$ as a function, $h$, which takes $x$ and returns the function $y \\rightarrow f(x,y)$ so that $h(x)(y) = f(x, y)$.\n\n\n### Visualizing the gradient\n\n\nThe gradient is not a univariate function, a simple vector-valued function, or a scalar function, but rather a *vector field* (which will  be discussed later). For the case, $f: R^2 \\rightarrow R$, the gradient will be a function which takes a point $(x,y)$ and returns a vector , $\\langle \\partial{f}/\\partial{x}(x,y), \\partial{f}/\\partial{y}(x,y) \\rangle$. We can visualize this by plotting a vector at several points on a grid. This task is made easier with a function like the following, which handles the task of vectorizing the values. It is provided within the `CalculusWithJulia` package:\n\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction vectorfieldplot!(V; xlim=(-5,5), ylim=(-5,5), nx=10, ny=10, kwargs...)\n\n    dx, dy = (xlim[2]-xlim[1])/nx, (ylim[2]-ylim[1])/ny\n    xs, ys = xlim[1]:dx:xlim[2], ylim[1]:dy:ylim[2]\n\n    ps = [[x,y] for x in xs for y in ys]\n    vs = V.(ps)\n\tλ = 0.9 * minimum([u/maximum(getindex.(vs,i)) for (i,u) in enumerate((dx,dy))])\n\n    quiver!(unzip(ps)..., quiver=unzip(λ * vs))\n\nend\n```\n\n\nHere we show the gradient for the scalar function $f(x,y) = 2 - x^2 - 3y^2$ over the region $[-2, 2]\\times[-2,2]$ along with a contour plot:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=55}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nf(x,y) = 2 - x^2 - 3y^2\nf(v) = f(v...)\n\nxs = ys = range(-2,2, length=50)\n\np = contour(xs, ys, f, nlevels=12)\nvectorfieldplot!(p, gradient(f), xlim=(-2,2), ylim=(-2,2), nx=10, ny=10)\n\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=53}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-56-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe figure suggests a potential geometric relationship between the gradient and the contour line to be explored later.\n\n\n## Differentiable\n\n\nWe see here how the gradient of $f$, $\\nabla{f} = \\langle f_{x_1}, f_{x_2}, \\dots, f_{x_n} \\rangle$, plays a similar role as the derivative does for univariate functions.\n\n\nFirst, we consider the role of the derivative for univariate functions. The main characterization - the derivative is the slope of the line that best approximates the function at a point - is quantified by Taylor's theorem. For a function $f$ with a continuous second derivative:\n\n\n\n$$\nf(c+h) = f(c) = f'(c)h + \\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi) h^2,\n$$\n\n\nfor some $\\xi$ within $c$ and $c+h$.\n\n\nWe re-express this through:\n\n\n\n$$\n(f(c+h) - f(c)) - f'(c)h  =\\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi) h^2.\n$$\n\n\nThe right hand side is the *error* term between the function value at $c+h$ and, in this case, the linear approximation at the same value.\n\n\nIf the assumptions are relaxed, and $f$ is just assumed to be *differentiable* at $x=c$, then only this is known:\n\n\n\n$$\n(f(c+h) - f(c)) - f'(c)h  = \\epsilon(h) h,\n$$\n\n\nwhere $\\epsilon(h) \\rightarrow 0$ as $h \\rightarrow 0$.\n\n\nIt is this characterization of differentiable that is generalized to define when a scalar function is *differentiable*.\n\n\n> *Differentiable*: Let $f$ be a scalar function. Then $f$ is [differentiable](https://tinyurl.com/qj8qcbb) at a point $C$ **if** the first order partial derivatives exist at $C$ **and** for $\\vec{h}$ going to $\\vec{0}$:\n>\n> $\\|f(C + \\vec{h}) - f(C) - \\nabla{f}(C) \\cdot \\vec{h}\\| = \\mathcal{o}(\\|\\vec{h}\\|),$\n>\n> where $\\mathcal{o}(\\|\\vec{h}\\|)$ means that dividing the left hand side by $\\|\\vec{h}\\|$ and taking a limit as $\\vec{h}\\rightarrow 0$ the limit will be $0$..\n\n\n\nThe limits here are for limits of scalar functions, which means along any path going to $\\vec{0}$, not just straight line paths, as are used to define the partial derivatives. Hidden above, is an assumption that there is some open set around $C$ for which $f$ is defined for $f(C + \\vec{h})$ when $C+\\vec{h}$ is in this open set.\n\n\nThe role of the derivative in the univariate case is played by the gradient in the scalar case, where $f'(c)h$ is replaced by $\\nabla{f}(C) \\cdot \\vec{h}$. For the univariate case, differentiable is simply the derivative existing, but saying a scalar function is differentiable at $C$ is a stronger statement than saying it has a gradient or, equivalently, it has partial derivatives at $C$, as this is assumed in the statement along with the other condition.\n\n\nLater we will see how Taylor's theorem generalizes for scalar functions and interpret the gradient geometrically, as was done for the derivative (it being the slope of the tangent line).\n\n\n## The chain rule to evaluate $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma$\n\n\nIn finding a partial derivative, we restricted the surface along a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane, in this case the curve $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)=\\langle t, c\\rangle$. In general if we have a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane, $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)$, we can compose the scalar function $f$ with $\\vec{\\gamma}$ to create a univariate function. If the functions are \"smooth\" then this composed function should have a derivative, and some version of a \"chain rule\" should provide a means to compute the derivative in terms of the \"derivative\" of $f$ (the gradient) and the derivative of $\\vec{\\gamma}$ ($\\vec{\\gamma}'$).\n\n\n> *Chain rule*: Suppose $f$ is *differentiable* at $C$, and $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)$ is differentiable at $c$ with $\\vec{\\gamma}(c) = C$. Then $f\\circ\\vec{\\gamma}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\\nabla f(\\vec{\\gamma}(c)) \\cdot \\vec{\\gamma}'(c)$.\n\n\n\nThis is similar to the chain rule for univariate functions $(f\\circ g)'(u) = f'(g(u)) g'(u)$ or $df/dx = df/du \\cdot du/dx$. However, when we write out in components there are more terms. For example, for $n=2$ we have with $\\vec{\\gamma} = \\langle x(t), y(t) \\rangle$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{d(f\\circ\\vec{\\gamma})}{dt} =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dt}.\n$$\n\n\nThe proof is a consequence of the definition of differentiability and will be shown in more generality later.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nConsider the function $f(x,y) = 2 - x^2 - y^2$ and the curve $\\vec\\gamma(t) = t\\langle \\cos(t), -\\sin(t) \\rangle$ at $t=\\pi/6$.

The answer has a simplified answer:\n\n\nLet $\\vec\\gamma(t) = C + t \\langle a, b \\rangle$ be a line that goes through the point $C$ parallel, or in the direction of, to $\\vec{v} = \\langle a , b \\rangle$.\n\n\nThen the function $f \\circ \\vec\\gamma(t)$ will have a derivative when $f$ is differentiable and by the chain rule will be:\n\n\n\n$$\n(f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)'(\\vec\\gamma(t)) = \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\cdot \\vec\\gamma'(t) =\n\\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\cdot \\langle a, b\\rangle =\n\\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)).\n$$\n\n\nAt $t=0$, we see that $(f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)'(C) = \\nabla{f}(C)\\cdot \\vec{v}$.\n\n\nThis defines the *directional derivative* at $C$ in the direction $\\vec{v}$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Directional derivative} = \\nabla_{\\vec{v}}(f) =  \\nabla{f} \\cdot \\vec{v}.\n$$\n\n\nIf $\\vec{v}$ is a *unit* vector, then the value of the directional derivative is the rate of increase in $f$ in the direction of $\\vec{v}$.\n\n\nThis is a *natural* generalization of the partial derivatives, which, in two dimensions, are the directional derivative in the $x$ direction and the directional derivative in the $y$ direction.\n\n\nThe following figure shows $C = (1/2, -1/2)$ and the two curves. Planes are added, as it can be easiest to visualize these curves as the intersection of the surface generated by $f$ and the vertical planes $x=C_x$ and $y=C_y$\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=69}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=67}\n![](scalar_functions_files/figure-html/cell-70-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can then visualize the directional derivative by a plane through $C$ in the direction $\\vec{v}$.

The directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $\\vec{v}$ at $(x,y)$ is:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla{f}\\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|} = \\langle \\cos(x + 2y), 2\\cos(x + 2y)\\rangle \\cdot \\frac{\\langle 2, 1 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cos(x + 2y).\n$$\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nSuppose $f(x,y)$ describes a surface, and $\\vec\\gamma(t)$ parameterizes a path in the $x$-$y$ plane. Then the vector valued function $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle \\vec\\gamma_1(t), \\vec\\gamma_2(t), (f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)(t)\\rangle$ describes a path on the surface. The maximum steepness of the this path is found by maximizing the slope of the directional derivative in the direction of the tangent line.

At the point $(x,y)$ which sits on the level curve, we have indicated the gradient and the tangent curve to the level curve, or contour line. Worth reiterating, the gradient is not on the surface, but rather is a $2$-dimensional vector, but it does indicate a direction that can be taken on the surface. We will see that this direction indicates the path of steepest ascent.\n\n\nThe figure suggests a relationship between the gradient and the tangents to the contour lines. Let's parameterize the contour line by $\\vec\\gamma(t)$, assuming such a parameterization exists, let $C = (x,y) = \\vec\\gamma(t)$, for some $t$, be a point on the level curve, and $\\vec{T} = \\vec\\gamma'(t)/\\|\\vec\\gamma'(t)\\|$ be the tangent to to the level curve at $C$. Then the directional derivative at $C$ in the direction of $T$ must be $0$, as along the level curve, the function $f\\circ \\vec\\gamma = c$, a constant. But by the chain rule, this says:\n\n\n\n$$\n0 = (c)' = (f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)'(t) = \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\cdot \\vec\\gamma'(t)\n$$\n\n\nThat is the gradient is *orthogonal* to $\\vec{\\gamma}'(t)$. As well, is orthogonal to the tangent vector $\\vec{T}$ and hence to the level curve at any point. (As the dot product is $0$.)\n\n\nNow, consider a unit vector $\\vec{v}$ in the direction of steepest ascent at $C$. Since $\\nabla{f}(C)$ and $\\vec{T}$ are orthogonal, we can express the unit vector uniquely as $a\\nabla{f}(C) + b \\vec{T}$ with $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. The directional derivative is then\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla{f} \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\nabla{f}  \\cdot (a\\nabla{f}(C) + b \\vec{T}) = a \\| \\nabla{f} \\|^2  + b \\nabla{f} \\cdot \\vec{T} = a \\| \\nabla{f} \\|^2.\n$$\n\n\nThe will be largest when $a=1$ and $b=0$. That is, the direction of greatest ascent in indicated by the gradient. (It is smallest when $a=-1$ and $b=0$, the direction opposite the gradient.\n\n\nIn practical terms, if standing on a hill, walking in the direction of the gradient will go uphill the fastest possible way, walking along a contour will not gain any elevation. The two directions are orthogonal.\n\n\n## Other types of compositions and the chain rule\n\n\nThe chain rule we discussed was for a composition of $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$ with $\\vec\\gamma:R \\rightarrow R^n$ resulting in a function $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma:R \\rightarrow R$. There are other possible compositions.\n\n\nFor example, suppose we have an economic model for beverage consumption based on temperature given by $c(T)$. But temperature depends on geographic location, so may be modeled through a function $T(x,y)$. The composition $c \\circ T$ would be a function from $R^2 \\rightarrow R$, so should have partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ which should be expressible in terms of the derivative of $c$ and the partial derivatives of $T$.\n\n\nConsider a different situation, say we have $f(x,y)$ a scalar function, but want to consider the position in polar coordinates involving $r$ and $\\theta$. We can think directly of $F(r,\\theta) = f(r\\cdot\\cos(\\theta), r\\cdot\\sin(\\theta))$, but more generally, we have a function $G(r, \\theta)$ that is vector valued: $G(r,\\theta) = \\langle r\\cdot\\cos(\\theta), r\\cdot\\sin(\\theta) \\rangle$ ($G:R^2 \\rightarrow R^2$). The composition $F=f\\circ G$ is a scalar function of $r$ and $\\theta$ and the partial derivatives with respect to these should be expressible in terms of the partial derivatives of $f$ and the partial derivatives of $G$.\n\n\nFinding the derivative of a composition in terms of the individual pieces involves some form of the chain rule, which will differ depending on the exact circumstances.\n\n\n### Chain rule for a univariate function composed with a scalar function\n\n\nIf $f(t)$ is a univariate function and $G(x,y)$ a scalar function, the $F(x,y) = f(G(x,y))$ will be a scalar function and may have partial derivatives. If $f$ and $G$ are differentiable at a point $P$, then\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = f'(G(x,y)) \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = f'(G(x,y)) \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y},\n$$\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla{F} = \\nabla{f \\circ G} = f'(G(x,y)) \\nabla{G}(x,y).\n$$\n\n\nThe result is an immediate application of the univariate chain rule, when the partial functions are considered.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nImagine a scenario where sales of some commodity (say ice) depend on the temperature which in turn depends on location. Formally, we might have functions $S(T)$ and $T(x,y)$ and then sales would be the composition $S(T(x,y))$. How might sales go up or down if one moved west, or one moved in the northwest direction? These would be a *directional* derivative, answered by $\\nabla{S}\\cdot \\hat{v}$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the direction. Of importance would be to compute $\\nabla{S}$ which might best be done through the chain rule.\n\n\nFor example, if $S(T) = \\exp((T - 70)/10)$ and $T(x,y) = (1-x^2)\\cdot y$, the gradient of $S(T(x,y))$ would be given by:\n\n\n\n$$\nS'(T(x,y)) \\nabla{T}(x,y) = (S(T(x,y))/10) \\langle(-2xy, 1-x^2 \\rangle.\n$$\n\n\n### Chain rule for a scalar function, $f$, composed with a function $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$.\n\n\nIf $G(u_1, \\dots, u_m) = \\langle G_1, G_2,\\dots, G_n\\rangle$ is a function of $m$ inputs that returns $n$ outputs we may view it as $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$. The composition with a scalar function $f(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)=z$ from $R^n \\rightarrow R$ creates a scalar function from $R^m \\rightarrow R$, so the question of partial derivatives is of interest. We have:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (f \\circ G)}{\\partial u_i} =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_1} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_2} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i} + \\dots +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_n} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i}.\n$$\n\n\nThe gradient is then:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla(f\\circ G) =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_1} \\nabla{G_1} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_2} \\nabla{G_2} + \\dots +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_n} \\nabla{G_n} = \\nabla(f) \\cdot \\langle \\nabla{G_1}, \\nabla{G_2}, \\dots, \\nabla{G_n} \\rangle,\n$$\n\n\nThe last expression is a suggestion, as it is an abuse of previously used notation: the dot product isn't between vectors of the same type, as the rightmost vector is representing a vector of vectors. The [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) matrix combines these vectors into a rectangular array, though with the vectors written as *row* vectors. If $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$, then the Jacobian is the $n \\times m$ matrix with $(i,j)$ entry given by $\\partial G_i, \\partial u_j$:\n\n\n\n$$\nJ = \\left[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_m}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_m}\\\\\n& \\vdots & \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_m}\n\\end{align}\n\\right].\n$$\n\n\nWith this notation, and matrix multiplication we have $(\\nabla(f\\circ G))^t = \\nabla(f)^t J$.\n\n\n(Later, we will see that the chain rule in general has a familiar form using matrices, not vectors, which will avoid the need for a transpose.)\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nLet $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ be a scalar function. We have if $G(r, \\theta) = \\langle r\\cos(\\theta)(, r\\sin(\\theta) \\rangle$ then after simplification, we have $(f \\circ G)(r, \\theta) = r^2$. Clearly then $\\partial(f\\circ G)/\\partial r = 2r$ and $\\partial(f\\circ G)/\\partial \\theta = 0$.\n\n\nWere this computed through the chain rule, we have:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla G_1 &= \\langle \\frac{\\partial r\\cos(\\theta)}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial r\\cos(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \\rangle=\n\\langle \\cos(\\theta), -r \\sin(\\theta) \\rangle,\\\\\n\\nabla G_2 &= \\langle \\frac{\\partial r\\sin(\\theta)}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial r\\sin(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}  \\rangle=\n\\langle \\sin(\\theta), r \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nWe have $\\partial f/\\partial x = 2x$ and  $\\partial f/\\partial y = 2y$, which at $G$ are $2r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $2r\\sin(\\theta)$, so by the chain rule, we should have\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial (f\\circ G)}{\\partial r} &=\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial r} +\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial r} =\n2r\\cos(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) + 2r\\sin(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) =\n2r (\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta)) = 2r, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (f\\circ G)}{\\partial \\theta} &=\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial \\theta} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial \\theta} =\n2r\\cos(\\theta)(-r\\sin(\\theta)) + 2r\\sin(\\theta)(r\\cos(\\theta)) = 0.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n## Higher order partial derivatives\n\n\nIf $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$, the $\\partial f/\\partial x_i$ takes $R^n \\rightarrow R$ too, so may also have a partial derivative.\n\n\nConsider the case $f: R^2 \\rightarrow R$, then there are $4$ possible partial derivatives of order 2: partial in $x$ then $x$, partial in $x$ then $y$, partial in $y$ and then $x$, and, finally, partial in $y$ and then $y$.\n\n\nThe notation for the partial in $y$ *of* the partial in $x$ is:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial{y}\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial{\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}}}{\\partial{y}} = \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial{y}} = f_{xy}.\n$$\n\n\nThe placement of $x$ and $y$ indicating the order is different in the two notations.\n\n\nWe can compute these for an example easily enough:\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=73}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@syms x y\nf(x, y) = exp(x) * cos(y)\nex = f(x,y)\ndiff(ex, x, x), diff(ex, x, y), diff(ex, y, x), diff(ex, y, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=71}\n```\n(exp(x)*cos(y), -exp(x)*sin(y), -exp(x)*sin(y), -exp(x)*cos(y))\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn `SymPy` the variable to differentiate by is taken from left to right, so `diff(ex, x, y, x)` would first take the partial in $x$, then $y$, and finally $x$.\n\n\nWe see that `diff(ex, x, y)` and `diff(ex, y, x)` are identical.

Two rules of thumb are 1) the trail should not be steeper than 10 degrees 2) the outward slope (in the steepest downhill direction) should be around 5%. (A trail tread is not flat, but rather sloped downward, similar to the crown on a road, so that water will run to the downhill side of the tread, not along the tread, which would cause erosion. In the best possible world, the outslope will exceed the downward slope.)\n\n\nSuppose a trail height is described parametrically by a composition $(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t))$, where $\\vec\\gamma(t) = \\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle$. The vector $\\vec{T}(t) = \\langle x(t), y(t), \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\rangle$ describes the tangent to the trail at a point ($\\vec\\gamma(t)$). Let $\\hat{T}(t)$ be the unit normal, and $\\hat{P}(t)$ be a unit normal in the direction of the *projection* of $\\vec{T}$ onto the $x$-$y$ plane. (Make the third component of $\\vec{T}$ $0$, and then form a unit vector from that.)\n\n\nWhat expression below captures point 1 that the steepness should be no more than 10 degrees ($\\pi/18$ radians):\n\n::: {.cell hold='true' execution_count=109}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=107}\n```{=html}\n<form class=\"mx-2 my-3 mw-100\" name='WeaveQuestion' data-id='12427471954024938019' data-controltype=''>\n  <div class='form-group '>\n    <div class='controls'>\n      <div class=\"form\" id=\"controls_12427471954024938019\">\n        <div style=\"padding-top: 5px\">\n    <div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_12427471954024938019_1\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_12427471954024938019\"\n              id=\"radio_12427471954024938019_1\" value=\"1\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(|\\hat{T} \\cdot \\hat{P}| \\leq \\pi/18\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_12427471954024938019_2\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_12427471954024938019\"\n              id=\"radio_12427471954024938019_2\" value=\"2\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(|\\hat{T} \\cdot \\hat{P}| \\leq \\sin(\\pi/18)\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"form-check\">\n    <label class=\"form-check-label\" for=\"radio_12427471954024938019_3\">\n      <input class=\"form-check-input\" type=\"radio\" name=\"radio_12427471954024938019\"\n              id=\"radio_12427471954024938019_3\" value=\"3\">\n      </input>\n      <span class=\"label-body px-1\">\n        \\(|\\hat{T} \\cdot \\hat{P}| \\leq \\cos(π/18)\\)\n      </span>\n    </label>\n</div>\n\n    \n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div id='12427471954024938019_message' style=\"padding-bottom: 15px\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n<script text='text/javascript'>\ndocument.querySelectorAll('input[name=\"radio_12427471954024938019\"]').forEach(function(rb) {\nrb.addEventListener(\"change\", function() {\n    var correct = rb.value == 3;\n    var msgBox = document.getElementById('12427471954024938019_message');\n      if(correct) {\n    msgBox.innerHTML = \"<div class='pluto-output admonition note alert alert-success'><span> 👍&nbsp; Correct </span></div>\";\n    var explanation = document.getElementById(\"explanation_12427471954024938019\")\n    if (explanation != null) {\n       explanation.style.display = \"none\";\n    }\n  } else {\n    msgBox.innerHTML = \"<div class='pluto-output admonition alert alert-danger'><span>👎&nbsp; Incorrect </span></div>\";\n    var explanation = document.getElementById(\"explanation_12427471954024938019\")\n    if (explanation != null) {\n       explanation.style.display = \"block\";\n    }\n  }\n\n})});\n\n</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe normal to the surface $z=f(x,y)$ is *not* the normal to the trail tread.
