# CalculusWithJulia via quarto

Short cut. Run first command until happy, then run second to publish

```
quarto render
# maybe git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render
```


But better to 

```
quarto render
# commit changes and push
# fix typos
quarto render
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render
```


To compile the pages through quarto


* author in `.qmd` files (to be run through pluto)
* run `quarto preview` to develop interactively (kinda slow!)
* run `quarto render` to render pages (not too bad)

# to publish

* bump the version number in `_quarto.yml`, `Project.toml`
* run `quarto publish gh-pages` to publish
* or `quarto publish gh-pages --no-render` to avoid re-rendering, when just done
* should also push project to github
* no need to push `_freeze` the repo, as files are locally rendered for now.

* NO LONGER to get `PlotlyLight` to work the plotly library needs loading **before** require.min.js. This is accomplished by **editing** the .html file and moving up this line: <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.11.0.min.js"></script>

This can be done with this commandline call: julia adjust_plotly.jl

* This error
> fatal: 'gh-pages' is already checked out at '/Users/verzani/julia/CalculusWithJuliaNotes/quarto/f5611730'

was solved with (https://waylonwalker.com/til/git-checkout-worktree/)
> git worktree remove f5611730

```
quarto render; julia adjust_plotly.jl
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render
```



# ------

In summary, there are two steps

```
quarto render
```

Preview output in `_book/index.html`. If okay to publish:


```
julia adjust_plotly.jl
quarto publish gh-pages --no-render
```

Then one should:

* push changes to origin
* merge into main
* branch to new version
* pull origin to merge





---
Eventually, if this workflow seems to be settled:

	* deprecate need to make "pluto friendly"
* take advantage of mermaid, ojs, bibliography, ...

DONE * move to not use CalculusWithJulia.WeaveSupport
DONE * remove frontmatter
DONE * fig_size -> _common_code
DONE * deprecate .jmd files
DONE? * do something with JSXGraph
DONE * figure out why PlotlyLight doesn't work XXX hacky!
DONE * use an include file not the "hack" in jmd2qmd
DONE * modify sympy's show method


## TODO

* Old and new astronomy; : Proctor, Richard Anthony, 1837-1888 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive


https://archive.org/details/oldnewastronomy00procuoft
https://ia800908.us.archive.org/16/items/oldnewastronomy00procuoft/oldnewastronomy00procuoft.pdf has interesting epicycle figures on p 186/886. Could add these in.

* ImageFile -> ![]() as much as possible
* use pandoc references(?)
* mermaid, ojs?

CAN'T DO * set up quarto to generate on CI. (Tried, but can't get through to the finish before a CI timeout...; Must use quarto publish command locally...)
DONE * PlotlyLight
DONE * clean up edit link
DONE * remove pinned header
DONE * clean up directory
DONE (?) * JSXGraph files
WON'T DO * download links to Pluto .jl files (if we have .jmd, but we might deprecate...) For *now* .jmd is deprecated; though we keep the files around ....

## Cone, general

basecurve(u) = [cos(u), sin(u) + sin(u/2), 0]
Vertex = [0, 3/4, 3]
function Cone(u, t)
	x, y, z = basecurve(u)
	t * ([x,y,z] - Vertex) + Vertex
end

us = range(0, 2pi, length=50)
ts = range(0, 1, length=50)

xyzs = Cone.(us, ts')
surface(CalculusWithJulia.unzip(xyzs))
