# Alternative packages

These notes use a particular selection of packages. This selection could have been different. For example:

* The symbolic math is provided by `SymPy`. [Symbolics](./alternatives/symbolics.html) (along with `SymbolicUtils` and `ModelingToolkit`) provides an alternative.

* The finding of zeros of scalar-valued, univariate functions is done with `Roots`. The [NonlinearSolve](./alternatives/SciML.html#nonlinearsolve) package provides an alternative for univariate and multi-variate functions.

* The finding of minima and maxima was done mirroring the framework of a typical calculus class; the [Optimization](./alternatives/SciML.html#optimization-optimization.jl) package provides an alternative.

* The computation of numeric approximations for definite integrals is computed with the `QuadGK` and `HCubature` packages. The [Integrals](./alternatives/SciML.html#integration-integrals.jl) package provides a unified interface for numeric  integration, including these two packages, among others.

* Plotting was done using the popular `Plots` package. The [Makie](./alternatives/makie_plotting.html) package provides a very powerful alternative. Whereas the [PlotlyLight](./alternatives/plotly_plotting.html) package provides a light-weight alternative using an open-source JavaScript library.
